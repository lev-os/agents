# Analyzing Alternative Data Signals

## When To Use

- Evaluating a new alternative data vendor or dataset for potential alpha generation
- Assessing signal strength, decay, and capacity of non-traditional data sources (satellite imagery, credit card transactions, web traffic, app usage, geolocation, NLP sentiment, job postings, shipping/logistics)
- Integrating an alt data signal into an existing systematic or factor-based strategy
- Performing due diligence on data coverage, history length, survivorship bias, and licensing terms before committing to a feed
- Comparing multiple alt data sources for the same investment thesis

## Inputs To Gather

- **Dataset specification**: Vendor name, data type (satellite, NLP, transactional, geolocation, web-scraped), delivery format (API, flat file, streaming), update frequency (real-time, daily, weekly)
- **Coverage and history**: Universe of securities/entities covered, geographic scope, historical backfill depth, and any known gaps or survivorship issues
- **Target hypothesis**: The specific alpha thesis the signal is meant to capture (e.g., "satellite car-count data predicts same-store-sales surprises for big-box retailers")
- **Benchmark and universe**: The investment universe and benchmark against which signal performance will be measured
- **Existing signals**: Current factor exposures or signals in the portfolio, to assess incremental value and correlation structure
- **Constraints**: Licensing restrictions, PII/compliance concerns, cost, exclusivity terms, and redistribution limitations [VERIFY regulatory requirements per jurisdiction — GDPR, CCPA, and securities regulations may restrict certain data types]

## Workflow

1. **Classify the data source**
   - Categorize by type: imagery/geospatial, transactional/consumer, web/social, sensor/IoT, workforce/HR, government/regulatory filings
   - Identify the economic mechanism linking the data to asset returns (revenue nowcasting, demand estimation, supply-chain tracking, sentiment shift detection)
   - Flag whether the data is exhaust data (generated as byproduct) vs. purposefully collected — this affects persistence and competitive dynamics

2. **Assess data quality and coverage**
   - Check history length vs. minimum required for statistically meaningful backtest (typically 5+ years for equity signals, 2+ for higher-frequency)
   - Evaluate coverage breadth: what percentage of the target universe has usable observations, and is coverage biased (e.g., urban-only geolocation, large-cap-only web traffic)
   - Test for stale/missing data patterns, time-zone alignment issues, and retroactive revisions
   - Confirm point-in-time availability — verify no lookahead bias in timestamps

3. **Construct and normalize the signal**
   - Define the raw metric extraction (e.g., pixel intensity → car counts, article text → sentiment score)
   - Apply cross-sectional normalization (z-score, percentile rank) to control for sector, market-cap, or geographic effects
   - Set signal update lag realistically — account for data delivery delay, processing time, and any embargo periods
   - Determine appropriate signal transformation: level, change, surprise vs. consensus, acceleration

4. **Backtest for alpha content**
   - Run univariate long/short quintile or decile sorts; report annualized spread return, Sharpe, hit rate, and turnover
   - Measure signal decay: IC (information coefficient) at multiple horizons (1-day, 5-day, 21-day, 63-day)
   - Test robustness across sub-periods, sectors, and market regimes (risk-on/risk-off, high/low volatility)
   - Control for known factors (market, size, value, momentum, quality) — report incremental IC after factor-neutralization
   - Assess capacity: estimate the dollar AUM at which market impact erodes >50% of gross alpha

5. **Evaluate operational and compliance risk**
   - Review vendor contract for exclusivity window, data clawback provisions, and termination terms
   - Confirm compliance with web-scraping terms of service, data privacy regulations, and material non-public information (MNPI) boundaries [VERIFY with compliance counsel — MNPI classification varies by data type and jurisdiction]
   - Assess vendor concentration risk: single-source dependency, vendor financial stability, alternative suppliers
   - Document data lineage and transformation pipeline for audit trail

6. **Determine integration path**
   - Quantify marginal Sharpe improvement when combined with existing signal library (correlation analysis, mean-variance optimization)
   - Define signal weighting scheme: equal weight, IC-weighted, or optimized
   - Specify rebalance frequency and portfolio construction rules for the combined signal
   - Set monitoring triggers: minimum IC threshold, coverage deterioration alert, regime-break detector

## Output

Produce an **Alternative Data Signal Assessment Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Data type, vendor, target thesis, and go/no-go recommendation with confidence level
- **Signal profile table**: IC mean/median, IC-IR, quintile spread return, Sharpe, turnover, max drawdown, decay half-life
- **Factor exposure analysis**: Correlation with standard factors and existing proprietary signals
- **Capacity estimate**: Estimated max AUM with acceptable slippage
- **Coverage and quality scorecard**: History depth, universe coverage %, missing-data rate, point-in-time verification status
- **Risk and compliance flags**: MNPI concerns, licensing restrictions, vendor dependency, privacy regulation exposure
- **Integration recommendation**: Suggested weight, rebalance cadence, and monitoring framework

## Quality Checks

- Confirm no lookahead bias — all signal values must be constructed from data available at the point-in-time of each observation
- Verify that backtest returns are reported net of realistic transaction costs and market impact estimates
- Ensure factor-neutralized results are reported alongside raw results to isolate true incremental alpha
- Check that out-of-sample or walk-forward validation is included (not just full-sample backtest)
- Validate that coverage statistics exclude stale or interpolated observations
- Flag any data source where legal/compliance review has not been completed as [VERIFY]
- Confirm signal decay analysis covers horizons relevant to the target strategy's holding period
