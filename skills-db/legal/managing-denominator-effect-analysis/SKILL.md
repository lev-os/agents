# Managing Denominator Effect Analysis

## When To Use

- Public equity or fixed-income markets have declined materially (10%+ drawdown), shrinking LP total portfolio NAVs while private-market valuations lag
- An LP or group of LPs signals allocation-policy concerns, re-up hesitation, or secondary sale exploration
- The GP needs to model how market declines translate into over-allocation across the LP base and what that means for future fundraising pace or capital-call timing
- Annual or quarterly LP portfolio review reveals private-market allocations exceeding policy targets
- Preparing talking points for an LPAC meeting or investor day where denominator-effect pressure is anticipated

## Inputs To Gather

- **LP allocation data**: Target allocation percentages to private equity/alternatives, current reported allocations, policy bandwidth (e.g., 15% target ± 3%)
- **LP total portfolio NAV**: Most recent reported total portfolio value; prior-period value for trend comparison
- **Fund-level data**: Current fund NAV, unfunded commitments, projected capital-call schedule, projected distribution pace
- **Public-market benchmark levels**: Relevant index values (S&P 500, MSCI ACWI, Bloomberg Agg) at reporting date vs. prior period
- **LP-specific constraints**: Hard caps vs. soft guidelines, board-approval thresholds, liquidity requirements, secondary-market appetite
- **Fundraising timeline**: Target close dates, expected commitment amounts, LP re-up assumptions

## Workflow

1. **Quantify the denominator shift**
   - Calculate the percentage decline in each LP's total portfolio NAV using public-market proxy returns
   - Recompute the LP's private-market allocation percentage holding private NAV constant (lagged marks)
   - Determine the over-allocation delta: actual allocation minus policy target

2. **Segment the LP base by severity**
   - Tier 1 — Within policy bandwidth: no immediate action needed
   - Tier 2 — Exceeds soft limit but below hard cap: monitor, may slow re-ups
   - Tier 3 — At or above hard cap: high risk of secondary sales, re-up refusal, or capital-call deferrals [VERIFY: confirm each LP's specific policy language on hard vs. soft caps]

3. **Model rebalancing scenarios**
   - Scenario A (market recovery): public markets rebound X%, allocation normalizes by Q[n] — estimate timeline
   - Scenario B (flat markets): over-allocation persists, LP must reduce private exposure by $[amount] or wait for distributions
   - Scenario C (further decline): over-allocation worsens, quantify incremental pressure
   - For each scenario, estimate the GP's aggregate available capital and the share of LPs likely to participate in the next fund or co-invest

4. **Assess pace-adjustment options**
   - Slow capital calls: extend drawdown period, quantify impact on fund IRR and deployment targets
   - Accelerate distributions: identify portfolio companies where early exit, recap, or dividend recap is feasible
   - Offer LP relief mechanisms: excuse rights activation, commitment reduction negotiations, structured secondary facilitation
   - Adjust fundraising timeline: delay next fund launch or reduce target size, model fee-revenue impact on GP

5. **Prepare LP-facing communication**
   - Draft a concise denominator-effect briefing showing the math (total portfolio decline → allocation overshoot → expected normalization path)
   - Include peer-context data: average PE allocation overshoot across similar endowments/pensions if available [VERIFY: source peer data from industry surveys — Preqin, Cambridge, ILPA]
   - Propose specific GP-side accommodations and request LP feedback on preferred approach

## Output

- **Denominator Effect Summary Table**: Each LP row showing prior allocation, current estimated allocation, policy target, bandwidth, over-allocation delta, and severity tier
- **Scenario Analysis Matrix**: Three scenarios (recovery / flat / further decline) with projected allocation normalization timelines and aggregate capital availability
- **Pace Adjustment Recommendations**: Ranked options with quantified trade-offs (IRR impact, fee impact, LP relationship risk)
- **LP Communication Draft**: One-page briefing suitable for investor-relations distribution, with charts showing allocation drift and normalization paths
- **Risk Register**: LP-specific flags — secondary-sale risk, re-up risk, LPAC escalation triggers

## Quality Checks

- Verify that allocation math ties back to reported NAVs — no rounding shortcuts that distort tier assignments
- Confirm that public-market return assumptions match the actual benchmarks each LP uses (some use custom blends, not a single index) [VERIFY]
- Ensure scenario assumptions are internally consistent (e.g., recovery scenario uses the same valuation-lag assumption as base case)
- Cross-check that pace-adjustment IRR impacts are modeled using the fund's actual cash-flow schedule, not generic assumptions
- Validate that LP policy parameters (targets, caps, bandwidth) reflect current IPS language, not outdated figures
- Flag any LP where data is stale (>1 quarter old) or self-reported without independent verification
