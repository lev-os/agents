# Managing Bridge Loan Commitments

Structures bridge financing with commitment terms, flex provisions, and permanent takeout analysis for acquisition financing.

## When To Use

- Arranging bridge-to-bond or bridge-to-term-loan facilities for M&A transactions
- Evaluating commitment papers and flex provisions from arranging banks
- Managing the transition timeline from bridge commitment to permanent takeout
- Assessing economics of bridge carry vs. accelerated takeout across rate scenarios
- Coordinating between acquisition counsel, bank counsel, and capital markets desks on commitment documentation

## Inputs To Gather

- **Commitment letter and fee letter** — identify commitment amount, pricing grid (initial spread, step-ups), duration cap, and any securities demand feature
- **Flex provisions** — extract market flex (spread flex, OID flex, structure flex) and reverse flex terms with caps/floors
- **Permanent takeout assumptions** — target bond/loan terms, expected execution timeline, rating agency feedback, and investor appetite indicators
- **Transaction timeline** — signing date, expected closing date, marketing window, sunset/termination dates for commitment
- **Fee schedule** — commitment fees, ticking fees (start date and accrual rate), duration fees, and any rollover or extension fees
- **Conditions precedent** — material adverse change definitions, certain funds provisions, SunGard conditionality standards [VERIFY — confirm whether SunGard-style or modified certain-funds applies in the jurisdiction]
- **Syndication strategy** — hold levels, target sell-down, flex exercise triggers, and general syndication vs. club deal structure

## Workflow

1. **Map the commitment structure**
   - Parse commitment letter for aggregate bridge amount, tranches (e.g., secured vs. unsecured bridge), and currency splits
   - Identify the initial pricing (spread over reference rate), OID, and step-up schedule (typically +25–50 bps per quarter after initial period)
   - Note the commitment expiry date and any extension mechanics

2. **Analyze flex provisions**
   - Catalog market flex: maximum spread widening (e.g., +75 bps total), OID flex (e.g., up to 98.0), and structure flex (ability to shift between secured/unsecured or add tranches)
   - Identify reverse flex triggers — conditions under which pricing tightens and economics improve
   - Model worst-case cost of carry under full flex exercise vs. base case
   - Flag any "clear market" provisions that restrict the borrower's other debt issuance during the marketing period

3. **Build the takeout analysis**
   - Define target permanent instruments (high-yield bonds, term loan B, investment-grade notes) with expected pricing
   - Compare all-in bridge cost (including fees and step-ups) to permanent market execution at various timing scenarios: T+30, T+60, T+90, T+180
   - Calculate breakeven — the point at which holding the bridge becomes more expensive than early takeout at wider permanent pricing
   - Factor in call protection / non-call periods on permanent instruments that may affect refinancing flexibility

4. **Track fee economics**
   - Build a fee waterfall: commitment fee (signing to closing), ticking fee (typically starts 60–90 days post-commitment [VERIFY — confirm ticking fee start date in commitment letter]), duration fee (if bridge remains outstanding past initial period)
   - Calculate total fee drag at each takeout scenario
   - Compare net economics across arranging banks if multiple commitment packages are in play

5. **Monitor syndication and transition**
   - Track investor feedback during marketing window — orderbook coverage, pricing talk adjustments
   - Flag flex exercise decisions: document rationale when arranger proposes flex, assess impact on borrower's total cost
   - Manage the mechanical transition: bridge drawdown mechanics (if needed), concurrent paydown from permanent proceeds, lien releases, and intercreditor adjustments
   - Confirm consent and notice requirements for bridge-to-permanent conversion under credit documentation

6. **Prepare status reporting**
   - Produce a bridge commitment tracker with: commitment amount, current pricing, fee accruals to date, next step-up date, takeout progress, and syndication status
   - Summarize key decision points and deadlines (commitment expiry, marketing launch, pricing date)
   - Escalate any flex exercise, waiver requests, or timeline slippage to senior stakeholders

## Output

- **Bridge Commitment Summary** — one-page overview of commitment terms, flex bounds, fee schedule, and key dates
- **Flex Scenario Analysis** — table showing all-in cost under base case, partial flex, and full flex scenarios
- **Takeout Comparison Matrix** — side-by-side of permanent instrument options with breakeven timing analysis
- **Fee Waterfall Schedule** — timeline-based fee accrual showing cumulative cost at each milestone
- **Status Dashboard** — current state of commitment, syndication progress, and upcoming decision points

## Quality Checks

- Verify that flex provision caps and floors are accurately extracted — a misread on spread flex can swing cost analysis by tens of millions on large commitments
- Confirm step-up timing aligns with the commitment letter (calendar quarters vs. anniversary-based) [VERIFY]
- Cross-check that certain-funds / SunGard conditions are correctly mapped to the acquisition agreement's closing conditions
- Ensure ticking fee start date, duration fee triggers, and commitment expiry are consistent across the commitment letter, fee letter, and any side letters
- Validate that takeout analysis uses current market benchmarks (reference rate, comparable bond spreads) rather than stale indicative pricing
- Confirm that any "market flex" exercise requires proper notice mechanics and is within the contractual window
