# Managing Medication Use Evaluations

Structures medication use evaluations (MUEs) with criteria development, data collection, and intervention tracking for continuous quality improvement.

## Why This Skill Exists

Medication Use Evaluations (MUEs)—also referred to as Drug Use Evaluations (DUEs)—are systematic, criteria-based assessments of medication prescribing, dispensing, administration, and outcomes. The Joint Commission (MM.08.01.01) requires accredited organizations to conduct ongoing evaluation of medication use, and ASHP Guidelines on Medication-Use Evaluation describe the standard methodology. CMS Conditions of Participation mandate that hospitals review their drug utilization as part of the quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program.

MUEs serve multiple purposes: identifying inappropriate prescribing patterns, measuring guideline adherence, detecting safety concerns, supporting formulary decisions, documenting cost-saving opportunities, and meeting regulatory requirements. Pharmacist-led MUEs have demonstrated reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use (20-40% improvement in stewardship-targeted MUEs), decreased ADR rates, improved guideline compliance, and documented cost savings. The P&T Committee relies on MUE data to make evidence-based formulary and policy decisions. A well-designed MUE follows the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle and includes clear criteria, representative sampling, objective data collection, analysis with benchmarks, and actionable intervention recommendations.

## Checkpoint A: Pre-Draft Intake (Mandatory)

1. What is the medication or drug class being evaluated? (Default: specify)
2. What is the purpose of this MUE (regulatory requirement, safety concern, cost, guideline adherence, P&T request)? (Default: identify trigger)
3. What is the study period and sample size? (Default: minimum 30 patients or 3-month period, whichever captures adequate data)
4. What care settings are included (inpatient, outpatient, ED, all)? (Default: inpatient)
5. What specific prescribing criteria will be evaluated? (Default: develop from guidelines)
6. What data sources are available (EHR, pharmacy dispensing system, billing data)? (Default: EHR + pharmacy system)
7. Has this drug been evaluated before? If so, what were prior MUE findings? (Default: search prior MUE reports)
8. Who is the intended audience for results (P&T Committee, medical staff, quality committee)? (Default: P&T Committee)

### Documents to Request

- Published clinical practice guidelines for the medication's indication(s)
- FDA-approved labeling with dosing, indications, and contraindications
- Prior MUE reports for the same medication (if applicable)
- Institutional prescribing policies or protocols for the medication
- Institutional antibiogram (if evaluating antimicrobials)
- National benchmarks (CMS quality measures, HEDIS, NQF indicators)
- EHR data extraction capabilities and available query reports
- P&T Committee meeting schedule and submission requirements

## Step 1: Define Evaluation Criteria

Develop explicit, measurable, evidence-based criteria for each dimension of medication use:

**Prescribing criteria (indication-based):**
- Indication matches FDA-approved or evidence-supported off-label use
- Dose is appropriate for indication, age, weight, and organ function
- Duration is within guideline recommendations (not excessive)
- Contraindications have been screened (allergies, drug interactions, organ impairment)
- Required baseline labs/diagnostics were obtained before initiation
- Appropriate therapeutic alternatives were considered (step therapy, formulary preferred)

**Dispensing criteria:**
- Correct drug, dose, and formulation dispensed
- DUR alerts were evaluated and documented
- Renal/hepatic dose adjustments applied

**Administration criteria:**
- Correct route and rate of administration
- Required monitoring performed (vital signs, infusion reactions)
- Pre-medications administered when required

**Outcome criteria:**
- Clinical efficacy achieved (disease-specific markers)
- Adverse drug reactions documented and reported
- Therapy discontinuation at appropriate endpoint
- Patient counseling documented

**Criteria format example (for each criterion):**

| Criterion # | Criterion Statement | Data Source | Standard (Target) |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-1 | Prescribed indication matches guideline-approved use | EHR diagnosis, order indication | 100% |
| P-2 | Dose adjusted for renal function (CrCl-based) | Labs + pharmacy system | ≥95% |
| P-3 | Duration within guideline-recommended range | MAR, discharge summary | ≥90% |
| O-1 | Clinical improvement documented at follow-up | Progress notes | ≥85% |
| S-1 | ADR documented and reported if occurred | ADR reports, nursing notes | 100% |

---

## Step 2: Data Collection Methodology

**Sample selection:**
- Define inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly
- Minimum sample: 30 patients or all patients in the study period if fewer
- Use consecutive or random sampling; avoid convenience sampling
- Document sampling method for reproducibility

**Data collection instrument:**
Design a standardized data collection form capturing:
- Patient demographics (age, sex, weight, relevant comorbidities)
- Medication details (drug, dose, route, frequency, start/stop dates)
- Indication and diagnosis codes
- Lab values (baseline and monitoring)
- Prescriber type and service
- Each evaluation criterion (met/not met/not applicable)
- Outcome variables (efficacy, safety, adherence)
- Free-text for notes and exceptions

**Data sources:**
- EHR (orders, notes, labs, vitals)
- Pharmacy dispensing system (fills, interventions, DUR overrides)
- ADR reporting system
- Billing/claims data (for cost analysis)

---

## Step 3: Analyze Results and Benchmark

**For each criterion, calculate:**
- Compliance rate: (Number meeting criterion / Total applicable) × 100%
- Compare against pre-defined target and national benchmarks
- Identify patterns: Which prescriber groups, units, or indications show lowest compliance?

**Statistical analysis (as appropriate):**
- Descriptive statistics: percentages, means, medians, ranges
- Pre/post comparison if this is a follow-up MUE
- Subgroup analysis by indication, prescriber, or patient population
- Cost analysis: per-patient and total institutional impact

**Benchmark sources:**
- Published literature compliance rates
- CMS quality measures (e.g., antibiotic timing in surgical prophylaxis)
- HEDIS measures (e.g., appropriate medication use indicators)
- Prior institutional MUE data (trending)
- ASHP best practices statements

## Step 4: Develop and Implement Interventions

Based on identified gaps, design targeted interventions:

| Gap Identified | Intervention Type | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Off-label use without evidence | Prescribing restriction or criteria-for-use | P&T Committee policy, EHR hard stop |
| Excessive duration | Default stop dates in CPOE | IT order set modification |
| Missing renal dose adjustments | Clinical decision support alert | EHR CDS rule |
| Lack of monitoring labs | Reminder/alert in pharmacy system | Protocol-driven monitoring order set |
| Inappropriate empiric choice | Education + antibiogram distribution | Grand rounds, pocket cards, EHR guidance |
| Cost opportunity | Therapeutic interchange to preferred agent | P&T-approved interchange protocol |

**Intervention tracking:**
- Document each intervention recommendation
- Assign responsible party and timeline
- Track implementation status (planned, in progress, completed, deferred)
- Define metrics for measuring intervention effectiveness

## Step 5: Report and Follow-Up

**MUE report structure for P&T Committee:**

1. **Executive summary** (1 paragraph: drug, purpose, key findings, recommendations)
2. **Background** (clinical context, regulatory requirement, prior MUE data)
3. **Methodology** (criteria, sample, data sources, study period)
4. **Results** (compliance rates by criterion, tables, figures)
5. **Discussion** (comparison to benchmarks, trends, patterns, root causes)
6. **Recommendations** (specific, actionable, with responsible parties and timelines)
7. **Financial impact** (cost savings or cost avoidance if applicable)
8. **Follow-up plan** (re-evaluation date, typically 6-12 months after intervention)

**Follow-up MUE:**
- Repeat data collection using identical criteria after intervention period
- Compare pre-intervention vs. post-intervention compliance rates
- Present comparison to P&T Committee
- Determine if further intervention or continued monitoring is needed

---

## Checkpoint B: Post-Draft Alignment (Mandatory)

1. Are evaluation criteria explicit, measurable, and evidence-based (not subjective)?
2. Is the sample size adequate to draw meaningful conclusions (minimum 30)?
3. Were compliance rates compared against pre-defined targets and external benchmarks?
4. Are intervention recommendations specific with assigned owners and timelines?
5. Is a follow-up re-evaluation date set (typically 6-12 months)?

## Guidelines

- MUE criteria must be derived from published clinical guidelines and FDA labeling, not institutional opinion alone
- Use a minimum sample of 30 patients for statistical meaningfulness; smaller samples reduce generalizability
- Concurrent (real-time) MUEs enable immediate intervention; retrospective MUEs enable broader analysis—choose based on goal
- Focus on high-risk, high-cost, high-volume, or problem-prone medications for maximum impact
- Avoid "shelf reports"—every MUE must result in at least one actionable recommendation presented to a governance body
- Track intervention implementation; an unimplemented recommendation has zero impact on patient care
- The PDSA cycle is iterative: Plan criteria → Do data collection → Study results → Act on interventions → repeat
- Coordinate MUE topics with antimicrobial stewardship, medication safety, and quality committees to avoid duplication
