# Analyzing Capital Structure Optimization

## When To Use

- Evaluating whether current leverage is optimal relative to peer benchmarks and rating thresholds
- Modeling target debt/equity mix to minimize weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Assessing financial flexibility ahead of M&A, share repurchase programs, or large capex cycles
- Responding to rating agency review, covenant pressure, or investor pushback on leverage
- Stress-testing capital structure resilience across interest rate and earnings scenarios

## Inputs To Gather

- **Financial statements**: Last 3–5 years of income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement (audited preferred)
- **Debt schedule**: All outstanding instruments with principal, coupon/rate, maturity, covenants, call provisions, and seniority
- **Market data**: Current share price, shares outstanding, equity beta, credit spreads, and benchmark risk-free rate
- **Peer comparables**: Net Debt/EBITDA, Debt/Total Capital, interest coverage, and credit ratings for 5–10 sector peers
- **Rating agency criteria**: Applicable methodology for the issuer's sector (S&P, Moody's, Fitch threshold tables) [VERIFY sector-specific thresholds]
- **Management inputs**: Target rating, dividend policy commitments, planned capex, M&A pipeline, and tolerance for financial risk
- **Macro assumptions**: Forward rate curve, tax rate (statutory and effective), and expected sector growth

## Workflow

1. **Profile current capital structure**
   - Calculate Net Debt/EBITDA, Debt/Total Capital, Interest Coverage (EBITDA/Interest and EBIT/Interest), FFO/Debt, and Free Cash Flow/Debt
   - Map each metric against rating agency threshold bands for the issuer's sector
   - Identify current implied credit rating vs. actual rating — flag any divergence

2. **Estimate component costs of capital**
   - Cost of equity: use CAPM (re-lever beta to each target leverage scenario) or build-up method; note equity risk premium assumption [VERIFY current ERP estimate]
   - Pre-tax cost of debt: interpolate from issuer's credit curve or comparable-rated issuers; apply marginal tax rate for after-tax cost
   - Compute WACC at current structure as baseline

3. **Model leverage scenarios**
   - Define 5–7 leverage increments (e.g., Net Debt/EBITDA from 0.5× to 4.0× in 0.5× steps)
   - For each scenario: re-lever equity beta, estimate implied rating, re-price cost of debt from rating-specific spread curves, and recalculate WACC
   - Identify the WACC-minimizing range — this is the theoretical optimum

4. **Assess rating and covenant impact**
   - For each scenario, check whether key ratios breach rating downgrade triggers or debt covenant thresholds
   - Quantify the cost of a one-notch downgrade: spread widening on outstanding and refinancing debt, potential covenant cross-defaults, counterparty/contract implications
   - Determine the practical optimum — the highest leverage that maintains the target rating with adequate cushion (typically 0.25–0.5× EBITDA buffer)

5. **Stress-test financial flexibility**
   - Apply downside scenarios: revenue decline of 10–20%, margin compression, rate shock (+200 bps), or combination
   - At each leverage level, test whether the company retains capacity to cover maintenance capex, dividends, and near-term maturities without needing emergency capital
   - Flag leverage levels where a single-scenario stress forces a rating breach or liquidity shortfall

6. **Evaluate transition path**
   - If optimal leverage differs materially from current: outline the instruments, sizing, and sequencing to migrate (e.g., incremental term loan, bond issuance, accelerated buyback, special dividend)
   - Estimate transaction costs, timing, and any tax implications of recapitalization [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific tax treatment of debt issuance costs and interest deductibility limits]
   - Consider market timing — current credit window, investor appetite, and rate environment

7. **Synthesize recommendation**
   - Present the recommended target leverage range with supporting WACC curve, rating mapping, and stress-test results
   - State the practical optimum as a range (not a point estimate) to account for model sensitivity
   - Highlight the 2–3 binding constraints that define the ceiling (e.g., rating threshold, covenant headroom, stress liquidity)

## Output

The deliverable is a **Capital Structure Optimization Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Current vs. recommended leverage, expected WACC improvement (bps), and rating implications — in 3–5 sentences
- **Current state profile**: Table of key credit metrics with rating agency threshold comparison
- **WACC sensitivity analysis**: Chart or table showing WACC across leverage scenarios with the minimizing range highlighted
- **Rating impact matrix**: Each scenario mapped to implied rating, spread, and annual incremental interest cost
- **Stress-test results**: Summary table showing metric headroom under base, moderate-stress, and severe-stress cases
- **Transition roadmap**: If recapitalization is warranted — instruments, sizing, timeline, and estimated execution cost
- **Key assumptions and limitations**: Explicit list of ERP, tax rate, spread curve, and growth assumptions used

## Quality Checks

- WACC curve should be U-shaped or flat — if monotonically decreasing, verify that cost-of-debt pricing reflects rating migration accurately
- Confirm that re-levered beta calculations use the correct unlevering/re-levering formula (Hamada or Harris-Pringle as appropriate for the company's debt policy) [VERIFY formula choice based on whether debt is fixed or rebalanced]
- Ensure peer set is sector-appropriate and excludes outliers (e.g., distressed companies, recent IPOs with atypical structures)
- Rating thresholds must match the agency's current published methodology — not outdated criteria
- Tax shield value should reflect actual interest deductibility constraints (e.g., Section 163(j) 30% EBITDA/EBIT limit in the US) [VERIFY applicable interest deductibility rules by jurisdiction]
- Stress scenarios should be calibrated to historical sector downturns, not arbitrary percentage drops
- Cross-check recommended range against what the company's equity and credit investors have signaled as acceptable
