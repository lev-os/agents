# Managing Renal Dose Adjustments

Adjusts medication doses based on renal function using CrCl and eGFR calculations to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity in kidney disease.

## Why This Skill Exists

The kidneys are the primary elimination route for approximately 25% of all drugs and the predominant clearance pathway for many critical medications including antibiotics, antivirals, anticoagulants, and cardiovascular agents. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)—affecting over 37 million Americans—or acute kidney injury (AKI), failure to adjust doses leads to drug accumulation, supratherapeutic levels, and potentially fatal toxicity (e.g., metformin-associated lactic acidosis, enoxaparin-related bleeding, gabapentin-induced encephalopathy).

Drug dosing references (Lexicomp, Micromedex, package inserts) provide renal adjustment guidelines, but the pharmacist must first accurately estimate renal function. The choice of estimation method—Cockcroft-Gault (CrCl), CKD-EPI (eGFR), or measured creatinine clearance—has direct dosing implications. Most drug labeling uses Cockcroft-Gault because clinical trials used this equation. KDIGO guidelines recommend CKD-EPI for staging CKD. Pharmacists must navigate this discordance and apply the correct equation for the specific drug while accounting for patient-specific variables (age, muscle mass, obesity, unstable renal function, dialysis).

## Checkpoint A: Pre-Draft Intake (Mandatory)

1. What is the patient's serum creatinine (most recent, ideally at steady state)? (Default: request lab)
2. What are the patient demographics: age, sex, actual body weight, height? (Default: request)
3. Is renal function stable or acutely changing (AKI)? (Default: compare SCr trend over 24-48h)
4. Is the patient receiving renal replacement therapy (HD, PD, CRRT)? (Default: verify)
5. Which medications in the patient's profile require renal dose adjustment? (Default: screen all active medications)
6. What is the patient's race/ethnicity (relevant for CKD-EPI 2021 equation)? (Default: CKD-EPI 2021 does not use race)
7. Are there factors affecting creatinine production (muscle wasting, amputation, severe liver disease, vegetarian diet)? (Default: assess)
8. What renal function estimation equation does the drug labeling use? (Default: Cockcroft-Gault for most drugs)

### Documents to Request

- Serum creatinine (current and 48-72h trend), BUN
- Patient demographics: age, sex, actual body weight, height
- Cystatin C if available (for creatinine-independent GFR estimation)
- Complete medication list with doses, routes, and frequencies
- Urinalysis with albumin/creatinine ratio
- Dialysis schedule, modality, and access type if applicable
- Fluid balance and hemodynamic status
- Prior renal function baseline if available

## Step 1: Estimate Renal Function

**Cockcroft-Gault Equation (CrCl in mL/min) — used for DRUG DOSING:**

CrCl = [(140 - age) × weight(kg)] / [72 × SCr(mg/dL)] × 0.85 (if female)

**Weight selection for Cockcroft-Gault:**
- Use actual body weight (ABW) if within 20% of ideal body weight (IBW)
- Use adjusted body weight if obese: AdjBW = IBW + 0.4 × (ABW - IBW)
- IBW male = 50 + 2.3 × (inches over 60)
- IBW female = 45.5 + 2.3 × (inches over 60)

**CKD-EPI 2021 (eGFR in mL/min/1.73m²) — used for CKD STAGING:**
- Race-free equation using age, sex, and serum creatinine
- Reports normalized to BSA (1.73 m²); may need to de-normalize for drug dosing:
  De-normalized GFR = eGFR × (patient BSA / 1.73)

**When to use which equation:**

| Purpose | Recommended Equation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Drug dosing (FDA labeling) | Cockcroft-Gault CrCl | Most drug labels studied with CG |
| CKD staging (KDIGO) | CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR | Standard for nephrology classification |
| DOAC dosing (AF indication) | Cockcroft-Gault CrCl | Pivotal trials used CG |
| Low muscle mass/unreliable creatinine | Cystatin C-based eGFR | When creatinine is unrepresentative |
| Acute kidney injury | Kinetic eGFR or CrCl trend | Static equations unreliable in AKI |

## Step 2: Identify Medications Requiring Adjustment

Screen the entire medication profile against renal dosing references. Prioritize:

**High-risk drugs requiring renal adjustment (commonly missed):**

| Drug | Normal Dose | CrCl 30-50 | CrCl 10-29 | CrCl <10 / HD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enoxaparin (treatment) | 1 mg/kg q12h | 1 mg/kg q12h | 1 mg/kg q24h | 1 mg/kg q24h |
| Gabapentin | 300-1200 mg TID | 200-700 mg BID | 100-300 mg daily | 125-350 mg post-HD |
| Metformin | 500-1000 mg BID | 500-1000 mg BID (CrCl ≥30) | Contraindicated <30 | Contraindicated |
| Levofloxacin | 750 mg daily | 750 mg q48h | 500 mg q48h | 500 mg q48h + post-HD dose |
| Vancomycin | Per PK dosing | Extended interval | Extended interval | Per levels; post-HD dosing |
| Acyclovir (IV) | 10 mg/kg q8h | 10 mg/kg q12h | 10 mg/kg q24h | 5 mg/kg q24h + post-HD |
| Allopurinol | 300 mg daily | 200 mg daily | 100 mg daily | 100 mg post-HD |
| Pregabalin | 150-300 mg BID | 75-150 mg BID | 25-75 mg daily | 25-75 mg post-HD supplement |
| Colchicine | 0.6 mg BID | 0.6 mg daily (CrCl <30) | 0.3 mg daily | Avoid |
| Dabigatran (AF) | 150 mg BID | 150 mg BID (CrCl 30-50) | 75 mg BID (CrCl 15-30) | Avoid <15 |

**Drugs to AVOID in severe renal impairment:**
- Metformin (CrCl <30): lactic acidosis risk
- Meperidine: normeperidine accumulation causes seizures
- Nitrofurantoin (CrCl <30): ineffective (poor urinary concentration) and neurotoxicity
- Spironolactone with CrCl <30 and K+ >5.0: severe hyperkalemia risk
- NSAIDs in CKD 4-5: accelerate renal decline, hyperkalemia, fluid retention

## Step 3: Apply Dose Modifications

Three approaches to renal dose adjustment:

1. **Reduce the dose, maintain the interval:**
   - Appropriate for drugs with concentration-dependent effects
   - Example: Reduce gabapentin from 300 mg TID to 300 mg BID

2. **Extend the interval, maintain the dose:**
   - Appropriate for drugs with time-dependent killing or prolonged effect
   - Example: Levofloxacin 750 mg q24h → 750 mg q48h

3. **Both reduce dose and extend interval:**
   - Appropriate for drugs with significant accumulation risk
   - Example: Acyclovir in severe CKD: reduce dose AND extend interval

**For each adjusted medication, document:**
- Original dose and frequency
- Renal function estimation (CrCl or eGFR with equation used)
- Adjusted dose and frequency with reference source
- Rationale for chosen adjustment strategy
- Monitoring plan (drug levels if applicable, efficacy markers, toxicity signs)

---

## Step 4: Dialysis Dosing Considerations

**Hemodialysis (HD):**
- Determine if the drug is dialyzable: molecular weight <500 Da, low protein binding, low Vd → likely dialyzed
- Schedule supplemental doses POST-dialysis for drugs removed by HD
- Hold pre-HD doses that would be immediately removed

**Peritoneal Dialysis (PD):**
- Less efficient drug removal than HD
- Dose as for CrCl <10 mL/min for most drugs

**Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT):**
- Drug clearance depends on modality (CVVH, CVVHD, CVVHDF), flow rates, and filter type
- Generally dose between CrCl 10-50 mL/min equivalence
- Use CRRT-specific dosing references (e.g., Heintz 2009 recommendations)
- Monitor drug levels when available (vancomycin, aminoglycosides)

## Step 5: Monitoring and Reassessment

| Monitoring Parameter | Frequency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Serum creatinine / CrCl | Daily (inpatient) or per visit (outpatient) | Recalculate and readjust if CrCl changes >20% |
| Drug levels (where applicable) | Per drug-specific schedule | Adjust dose based on measured levels |
| Signs of drug toxicity | Ongoing | Hold/reduce dose; consider alternative agent |
| Signs of therapeutic failure | Ongoing | Verify adequate dosing, not over-adjusted |
| Electrolytes (K+, Mg, Phos) | With renal function monitoring | Drug-renal interactions (ACEi/ARB + K+) |

---

## Checkpoint B: Post-Draft Alignment (Mandatory)

1. Was Cockcroft-Gault CrCl used for drug dosing decisions (not CKD-EPI eGFR unless drug-label specifies)?
2. Was the appropriate body weight selected (ABW, IBW, or AdjBW)?
3. Were all renally-cleared medications screened, not just the medication prompting the consult?
4. Are dialysis supplemental doses addressed for patients on RRT?
5. Is the monitoring plan specific with timeline for renal function reassessment?

- [ ] Electrolyte monitoring plan includes drug-renal interactions (K+ with ACEi/ARB)
- [ ] Documentation includes CrCl calculation, equation used, and weight metric
- [ ] Reassessment timeline specified for inpatient (daily SCr) and outpatient (per visit)
- [ ] Patient educated on medications to avoid (OTC NSAIDs, herbal supplements)

## Guidelines

- Use Cockcroft-Gault CrCl for drug dosing unless the specific drug's labeling explicitly uses eGFR—this is a fundamental principle
- SCr alone is an unreliable indicator of renal function; a "normal" SCr in an elderly, low-muscle-mass patient may mask significant impairment
- Round CrCl up to 10 mL/min if the calculated value is <10 in a non-dialysis patient producing urine
- In AKI, creatinine is not at steady state; assume worse renal function than the calculated value suggests
- Screen ALL medications on the profile when renal function changes—not just the one that triggered the consult
- Drugs with active metabolites (morphine → M6G, meperidine → normeperidine) require special attention even if parent drug clearance seems adequate
- Do not reflexively avoid all medications in renal impairment—underdosing harms patients too; adjust, don't just stop
- Coordinate with nephrology for CRRT-specific dosing when standard references are unavailable
