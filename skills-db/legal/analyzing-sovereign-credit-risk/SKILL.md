# Analyzing Sovereign Credit Risk

## When To Use

- Assessing creditworthiness of a sovereign issuer before purchasing or recommending government bonds
- Evaluating country risk for cross-border lending, project finance, or direct investment decisions
- Monitoring existing sovereign exposures for portfolio risk management or early-warning triggers
- Benchmarking sovereign credit quality across emerging or frontier market peer groups
- Supporting internal credit committee presentations on country-level risk appetite or limit-setting

## Inputs To Gather

- **Fiscal data**: Central government debt/GDP, primary balance, interest expense/revenue, debt maturity profile, contingent liabilities (SOE guarantees, PPP obligations) [VERIFY: source year and whether data uses IMF GFS or national accounting standards]
- **External accounts**: Current account balance/GDP, gross external financing needs, import cover (months of reserves), net international investment position, short-term external debt vs. reserves
- **Monetary indicators**: Inflation trajectory, exchange rate regime, central bank independence score, dollarization level, FX reserve adequacy (ARA metric or Guidotti ratio)
- **Political and institutional factors**: Governance indicators (WGI or equivalent), regime type and transition risk, rule-of-law index, history of debt restructuring or default, IMF program status
- **Market signals**: Sovereign CDS spreads, EMBI+ spread vs. benchmark, local-currency yield curve shape, recent rating actions or outlook changes from Moody's/S&P/Fitch
- **Structural context**: GDP growth trend, demographic profile, commodity dependence, trade concentration, sanctions exposure

## Workflow

1. **Define scope and purpose** — Confirm the sovereign, the currency of obligation (local vs. hard-currency), the investment horizon, and whether the analysis supports a new exposure decision, a limit review, or ongoing monitoring.

2. **Compile the fiscal profile**
   - Calculate debt sustainability metrics: debt/GDP level and trajectory, primary balance required for debt stabilization, gross financing needs as % of GDP.
   - Assess composition risk: share of FX-denominated debt, floating-rate exposure, non-resident holdings, average maturity and rollover concentration.
   - Identify contingent liabilities: state-owned enterprise debt, banking sector recapitalization risk, pension obligations. [VERIFY: whether contingent liabilities are included in headline debt figures]

3. **Evaluate external vulnerability**
   - Compute external financing gap: current account deficit + amortizations due within 12 months vs. available reserves and committed credit lines.
   - Stress-test reserve adequacy under capital flight or commodity price shock scenarios.
   - Assess exchange rate flexibility — fixed/pegged regimes face higher external adjustment risk; managed floats require evaluation of intervention capacity.

4. **Score political and institutional quality**
   - Map governance indicators to a qualitative tier (strong / adequate / weak) with specific evidence (recent elections, judicial independence events, corruption cases).
   - Evaluate willingness to pay: track record of honoring debt obligations, adherence to IMF conditionality, history of unilateral restructuring or selective default.
   - Flag upcoming political events (elections, referenda, coalition changes) that could shift fiscal or reform trajectory.

5. **Integrate market pricing**
   - Compare sovereign CDS spread and bond spread to model-implied fair value based on fundamentals; identify if the market is pricing in more or less risk than the fundamental analysis suggests.
   - Review recent rating agency actions and whether the current rating appears lagging or leading.

6. **Assign overall risk assessment**
   - Use a structured scorecard across fiscal (30%), external (25%), political/institutional (25%), and structural/growth (20%) dimensions — adjust weights to context. [VERIFY: whether your institution uses a proprietary weighting model]
   - Produce an internal credit tier (e.g., investment-grade equivalent, crossover, speculative) with directional outlook (stable, improving, deteriorating).
   - Identify the primary risk driver and the most plausible downgrade scenario.

7. **Formulate actionable recommendations**
   - State whether the sovereign is within acceptable risk appetite for the intended exposure type and tenor.
   - Recommend monitoring triggers: fiscal metric thresholds, reserve coverage floors, political event dates.
   - Suggest hedging considerations if exposure is approved (CDS, FX hedges, duration limits).

## Output

- **Executive summary**: One-paragraph credit opinion stating the sovereign, internal rating/tier, outlook, and primary risk factor.
- **Scorecard table**: Dimension-level scores with supporting data points and composite weighted score.
- **Fiscal snapshot**: Key ratios (debt/GDP, primary balance, interest/revenue, gross financing needs) with 3-year trend.
- **External vulnerability dashboard**: Reserve adequacy, current account, external debt maturity schedule.
- **Political risk narrative**: 2-3 paragraphs on institutional quality, willingness-to-pay assessment, and near-term event risk.
- **Peer comparison**: Positioning vs. 3-5 comparable sovereigns on key metrics.
- **Recommendation and triggers**: Go/no-go on exposure, conditions, monitoring thresholds, and re-review date.

## Quality Checks

- All fiscal and external data sourced from IMF, World Bank, central bank, or recognized provider — no unsourced figures
- Debt sustainability math is internally consistent (growth-adjusted interest rate dynamics check out)
- Political risk assessment cites specific events or indicators, not vague characterizations
- Scorecard weights sum to 100% and each dimension has at least two supporting data points
- Any data older than 18 months is flagged as potentially stale with [VERIFY] marker
- Contingent liabilities and off-balance-sheet exposures are explicitly addressed, even if immaterial
- Market pricing comparison included to guard against pure-fundamental bias
- Recommendation is clearly tied to a specific exposure type and tenor, not a blanket country view
