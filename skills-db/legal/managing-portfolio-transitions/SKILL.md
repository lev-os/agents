# Managing Portfolio Transitions

## When To Use

- Transitioning a portfolio from one investment manager or strategy to another
- Restructuring asset allocation after a policy change, liquidity event, or beneficiary update
- Liquidating or consolidating legacy positions into a new target model
- Onboarding a new client whose existing holdings must migrate into your platform
- Evaluating in-kind transfer versus liquidation-and-repurchase trade-offs

## Inputs To Gather

- **Current holdings report**: Full position-level detail including asset class, ticker/CUSIP, quantity, cost basis, lot-level acquisition dates, and current market value
- **Target portfolio model**: Asset allocation targets, approved security list, or model portfolio weights
- **Client/account constraints**: Tax status (taxable vs. tax-deferred), wash-sale exposure windows, concentrated stock restrictions, ESG or sector exclusions, and any contractual lock-ups
- **Cost parameters**: Expected bid-ask spreads for illiquid positions, estimated commission or trading costs, capital gains tax rates (short-term vs. long-term), and any early redemption fees on fund positions
- **Timeline**: Hard deadlines (e.g., manager termination date, custody transfer settlement), preferred transition pace (immediate vs. phased), and any blackout periods
- **Stakeholder contacts**: Outgoing manager, incoming manager, custodian, tax advisor, and compliance officer

## Workflow

1. **Legacy Position Analysis**
   - Map every holding to the target model: classify each as retain, sell, or replace
   - Flag positions with embedded unrealized gains/losses and note lot-level holding periods
   - Identify illiquid or hard-to-trade positions (private placements, thinly traded bonds, alternative fund interests with redemption gates)
   - Quantify concentrated positions as a percentage of total portfolio and note any Rule 144 or contractual restrictions [VERIFY]

2. **Transition Cost Estimation**
   - Calculate estimated market impact costs for each sell/buy trade using recent volume and spread data
   - Model tax consequences: aggregate short-term and long-term capital gains under liquidation scenarios versus in-kind transfer scenarios
   - Estimate opportunity cost of being out-of-model during the transition window
   - Produce a total transition cost budget (trading costs + tax drag + opportunity cost)

3. **Rebalancing Path Design**
   - Determine transition approach: big-bang (single-day execution), phased (multi-day/week tranches), or hybrid
   - For phased transitions, define tranche schedule with interim allocation targets at each step
   - Prioritize trades: harvest losses first, then liquidate positions furthest from target, then deploy proceeds into underweight asset classes
   - Incorporate tax-loss harvesting opportunities — pair gains with offsetting losses where possible
   - Set execution parameters: limit orders vs. market orders, VWAP/TWAP targets for large blocks, crossing network eligibility

4. **Execution and Custody Coordination**
   - Confirm custodian readiness for ACAT or DTC transfers for in-kind positions
   - Coordinate settlement timing so proceeds are available for reinvestment without cash drag
   - Track partial fills and adjust subsequent tranches accordingly
   - Log each trade with execution price, timestamp, and variance from pre-trade estimate

5. **Post-Transition Reconciliation**
   - Compare realized portfolio to target model — report tracking error and any residual drift
   - Reconcile actual transition costs against the pre-transition budget
   - Confirm cost basis records transferred accurately to the new custodian or manager platform
   - Document any remaining legacy positions with a liquidation timeline or rationale for retention

## Output

The deliverable is a **Portfolio Transition Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Transition rationale, total assets transitioned, timeline, and aggregate cost
- **Legacy holdings analysis table**: Each position with action taken (sold, transferred in-kind, retained), lot-level cost basis, gain/loss realized, and holding period
- **Transition cost summary**: Trading costs, tax impact, and opportunity cost versus budget
- **Rebalancing path**: Tranche schedule with interim and final allocation snapshots
- **Post-transition comparison**: Target model weights vs. actual weights with drift analysis
- **Open items**: Illiquid positions pending liquidation, pending ACAT transfers, unresolved cost basis discrepancies

## Quality Checks

- Verify all cost basis and lot date information against custodian statements before modeling tax impact
- Confirm wash-sale rule compliance: no repurchase of substantially identical securities within 30 days before or after a loss sale [VERIFY — IRS wash-sale rules; state-level variations may apply]
- Validate that the transition plan respects any IPS constraints, side-letter terms, or regulatory holding requirements
- Cross-check that in-kind transfer eligibility is confirmed with receiving custodian (not all custodians accept all security types)
- Ensure the total transition cost estimate includes all fee layers: commissions, spreads, redemption fees, and tax
- Flag any position exceeding 5% of portfolio value as a concentration risk requiring explicit client sign-off
- Mark all tax rate assumptions and regulatory thresholds with [VERIFY] since they depend on jurisdiction, account type, and current tax law
