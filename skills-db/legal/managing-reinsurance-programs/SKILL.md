# Managing Reinsurance Programs

## When To Use

- Analyzing an existing reinsurance program for renewal strategy or restructuring
- Optimizing cession structures across quota share, surplus, excess-of-loss, and catastrophe layers
- Evaluating reinsurer counterparty credit quality and concentration risk
- Pricing treaty or facultative placements and comparing broker submissions
- Assessing net retained risk positions after cessions and retrocessions
- Preparing reinsurance program summaries for board, rating agency, or regulatory review

## Inputs To Gather

- **Current treaty/facultative schedule**: All active reinsurance contracts with attachment points, limits, rates, and reinstatement provisions
- **Loss history**: At least 5–10 years of gross and net incurred/paid loss triangles by line of business
- **Exposure data**: Premium volume, policy counts, PMLs (probable maximum losses), and aggregate exposure by geography/peril
- **Counterparty information**: Reinsurer names, AM Best / S&P / Fitch ratings, collateral arrangements, and outstanding recoverables
- **Pricing indications**: Broker market submissions, rate-on-line quotes, and sliding-scale commission terms
- **Regulatory/rating constraints**: RBC requirements, rating agency capital model outputs, and jurisdictional cession limits [VERIFY]
- **Retrocession details**: Any retro covers purchased by reinsurers that affect credit assessment

## Workflow

1. **Map the current program**
   - Diagram each layer: proportional (quota share, surplus) and non-proportional (per-risk XOL, catastrophe XOL, aggregate stop-loss)
   - Record attachment points, co-participation, limits, reinstatement terms, and sunset/commutation clauses
   - Identify gaps or overlaps between layers and any uncovered exposure corridors

2. **Analyze cession efficiency**
   - Calculate cession ratios by line of business and compare to peer benchmarks
   - Model net retained volatility under current structure using historical and stochastic loss scenarios
   - Evaluate whether proportional vs. non-proportional mix appropriately balances earnings stability against cost of risk transfer
   - Test alternative structures: higher retentions, aggregate deductibles, multi-year deals, or indexed triggers

3. **Assess counterparty credit and concentration**
   - Review each reinsurer's financial strength rating and trend (stable, positive, negative outlook)
   - Calculate single-reinsurer and top-5-reinsurer concentration as a percentage of total ceded premium and recoverable balances
   - Evaluate collateral adequacy: letters of credit, trust accounts, funds-withheld arrangements
   - Flag any reinsurer on regulatory watch lists or with disputed balances [VERIFY]

4. **Price and benchmark layers**
   - Compute rate-on-line (ROL), rate-on-line adjusted for reinstatements, and expected loss ratio for each layer
   - Compare current pricing to catastrophe model output (e.g., AIR, RMS, Verisk) expected losses and historical burn cost
   - Evaluate sliding-scale and profit-sharing commissions for proportional treaties — model commission outcomes under different loss scenarios
   - Benchmark against market indices (Guy Carpenter ROL Index, Gallagher Re rate monitors) where available

5. **Model net retained position**
   - Run deterministic and stochastic scenarios (1-in-100, 1-in-250 return periods) on the net retained book
   - Calculate impact on RBC ratio, rating agency capital adequacy, and economic capital metrics
   - Stress-test for adverse development: reserve deterioration, clash events, correlated catastrophe losses
   - Quantify earnings-at-risk and capital-at-risk with and without proposed program changes

6. **Formulate renewal/restructuring recommendations**
   - Rank alternative structures by cost efficiency (cost of reinsurance per unit of volatility reduction)
   - Identify optimal retention levels balancing premium retention, capital relief, and tail-risk protection
   - Recommend reinsurer panel adjustments based on credit quality, pricing, and relationship value
   - Outline transition plan if restructuring mid-term (commutation mechanics, notice periods)

## Output

- **Program summary table**: Layer-by-layer breakdown showing type, attachment, limit, rate, reinsurer panel, and ratings
- **Cession optimization analysis**: Current vs. proposed structures with modeled net retained loss distributions
- **Counterparty scorecard**: Each reinsurer rated on financial strength, collateral, claims-paying history, and concentration share
- **Pricing comparison matrix**: ROL, expected loss, and margin analysis across layers and competing submissions
- **Net retained risk profile**: Capital adequacy metrics, earnings volatility, and tail-risk exposure under recommended structure
- **Executive recommendation memo**: Board-ready summary with key trade-offs, cost impacts, and action items for renewal

## Quality Checks

- Verify all attachment points and limits sum correctly with no unintended gaps between layers
- Confirm loss data used for pricing is developed to ultimate and adjusted for trend/IBNR
- Cross-check reinsurer ratings against the most recent agency publications — ratings can change quarterly [VERIFY]
- Ensure cession ratios comply with jurisdictional limits (e.g., credit-for-reinsurance statutes, authorized vs. unauthorized reinsurer rules) [VERIFY]
- Validate that collateral requirements satisfy domiciliary state regulations for non-admitted reinsurers [VERIFY]
- Confirm reinstatement premium calculations match contract language (pro-rata as to time, pro-rata as to amount, or both)
- Flag any assumptions about correlation between perils or lines of business in stochastic models — document model limitations explicitly
