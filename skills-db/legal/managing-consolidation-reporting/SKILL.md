# Managing Consolidation Reporting

Structures multi-entity consolidation reporting with elimination entries and intercompany reconciliation for organizations with multiple subsidiaries, divisions, or legal entities.

## When To Use

- Consolidating financial results across subsidiaries for period-end close (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Preparing elimination entries for intercompany transactions (revenue/expense, receivables/payables, investments/equity)
- Reconciling intercompany balances before consolidation
- Producing consolidated financial statements or management-level P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow reports
- Analyzing minority interest / non-controlling interest adjustments
- Rolling up divisional or segment-level results into a group-level view

## Inputs To Gather

- **Entity list and hierarchy**: Parent, subsidiaries, ownership percentages, consolidation method per entity (full, proportional, equity method) [VERIFY against current org chart]
- **Trial balances**: Period-end trial balance for each entity in local currency
- **Intercompany transaction logs**: IC invoices, management fees, loan balances, dividend declarations, and transfer pricing entries for the period
- **Foreign currency rates**: Closing rate for balance sheet, average rate for income statement, historical rate for equity items [VERIFY rate source and policy]
- **Prior-period consolidated balances**: Opening retained earnings, cumulative translation adjustments, goodwill and intangible asset schedules
- **Accounting policy alignment notes**: Any known GAAP differences between entities (e.g., revenue recognition timing, depreciation methods) [VERIFY if local-to-group GAAP adjustments are needed]
- **Ownership change events**: Acquisitions, disposals, or changes in ownership percentage during the period

## Workflow

1. **Map the consolidation scope**
   - Confirm which entities consolidate (full vs. equity method vs. excluded)
   - Validate ownership percentages and identify any non-controlling interests (NCI)
   - Determine reporting currency and translation methodology (current-rate method vs. temporal method) [VERIFY per entity]

2. **Standardize chart of accounts**
   - Map each subsidiary's local COA to the group-level consolidated COA
   - Flag unmapped accounts and resolve with entity controllers before proceeding
   - Apply any local-to-group GAAP reclassification entries

3. **Translate foreign currency entities**
   - Translate income statement at average rate, balance sheet at closing rate, equity at historical rate
   - Calculate cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) and post to other comprehensive income
   - Document rate sources and any override decisions

4. **Identify and record elimination entries**
   - **Intercompany revenue/expense**: Eliminate matching IC sales and cost of goods sold; investigate and resolve mismatches exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., >$1K or >0.5% of IC balance)
   - **Intercompany receivables/payables**: Net AR against AP across entities; reconcile timing differences
   - **Intercompany loans and interest**: Eliminate loan principal and accrued interest; confirm rates match
   - **Intercompany dividends**: Eliminate dividend income against the subsidiary's equity
   - **Intercompany profit in inventory**: Eliminate unrealized profit on goods still held by the purchasing entity at period-end
   - **Investment in subsidiary vs. subsidiary equity**: Eliminate parent's investment account against subsidiary's equity; allocate excess to goodwill or fair-value adjustments

5. **Calculate non-controlling interest**
   - Allocate NCI's share of subsidiary net income and net assets
   - Present NCI separately on the consolidated balance sheet (equity section) and income statement

6. **Reconcile and validate**
   - Confirm all IC balances net to zero after eliminations
   - Verify consolidated retained earnings roll-forward (opening + net income − dividends = closing)
   - Check that total assets = total liabilities + total equity post-consolidation
   - Compare consolidated results to prior period and budget; investigate significant variances

7. **Prepare consolidated outputs**
   - Consolidated income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement
   - Elimination journal entry schedule with references
   - IC reconciliation summary showing matched vs. unmatched items
   - Variance commentary for management review

## Output

- **Consolidated financial statements** (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow) at group level
- **Elimination entry schedule**: Each entry with debit/credit, entity pair, description, and supporting reference
- **Intercompany reconciliation report**: Entity-pair matrix showing IC balances before and after elimination, with open items flagged
- **CTA / translation adjustment schedule** (if multi-currency)
- **NCI allocation schedule** (if partial ownership entities exist)
- **Variance summary**: Period-over-period and budget-vs-actual at the consolidated level with brief commentary

## Quality Checks

- All intercompany balances net to zero — any residual difference is identified and explained
- Consolidated balance sheet balances (A = L + E) within an acceptable rounding tolerance
- Retained earnings roll-forward ties to the income statement and dividend activity
- Elimination entries are symmetrical (equal debits and credits) and reference source IC transactions
- Foreign currency translation follows the stated policy consistently across all entities [VERIFY methodology matches company policy and applicable standards, e.g., ASC 830 or IAS 21]
- NCI calculations reflect actual ownership percentages and any preference terms
- No duplicate elimination entries (e.g., same IC transaction eliminated twice from different perspectives)
- Period-end close calendar deadlines are tracked — flag any entity submissions that are late or incomplete
