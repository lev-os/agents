# Summarizing Earnings Calls

## When To Use

- Processing a quarterly or annual earnings call transcript into a structured research summary
- Preparing investment memos where beat/miss framing and guidance changes are the primary deliverable
- Tracking management narrative shifts across consecutive quarters for a coverage universe
- Building a comparable summary format across multiple tickers for portfolio-level review

## Inputs To Gather

Collect before drafting. Do not proceed without the required items.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Ticker / Company name** | Yes | Determines industry KPI set and peer context |
| **Quarter & fiscal year** | Yes | Anchors YoY and QoQ comparisons |
| **Consensus estimates** (Revenue, EPS minimum) | Yes | Enables beat/miss framing — omit beat/miss language entirely if unavailable |
| **Prior-quarter guidance** (if any) | Yes | Quantifies guidance revisions |
| **User's coverage context** | Recommended | "SaaS infrastructure analyst" vs. "generalist" shifts emphasis |
| **Specific focus areas** | Recommended | e.g., "margin trajectory," "China exposure," "AI capex" |
| **Prior-quarter summary** | Optional | Enables language-delta and KPI-trend analysis |
| **Industry vertical** | Auto-infer | Drives KPI extraction set (see Industry KPI Matrix below) |

## Workflow

### 1. Structural Parse

Segment the transcript into canonical sections:

1. **Operator / Safe Harbor** — confirm disclaimer exists; do not summarize it.
2. **CEO Prepared Remarks** — strategic narrative, high-level results, thematic emphasis.
3. **CFO Prepared Remarks** — revenue, margins, EPS, cash flow, balance sheet, guidance.
4. **Other Executive Remarks** — segment heads, CTO on product, etc.
5. **Analyst Q&A** — treat each question/answer pair as a discrete unit.

If section headers are missing, infer boundaries from speaker changes and flag with `[INFERRED SECTION BREAK]`.

### 2. Headline Numbers Extraction

Build the Financial Snapshot Table with these columns: Metric | Reported | Consensus | Beat/Miss | YoY Δ | QoQ Δ. Include at minimum: Revenue, Adj. EPS, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, FCF.

Rules:
- **Always state GAAP vs Non-GAAP basis.** If management leads with Non-GAAP, include both. Flag large adjustments (SBC > 10% of revenue, restructuring, one-time items).
- Use basis points (bps) for margin deltas, percentages for revenue/EPS deltas.
- Write "Not disclosed" for undisclosed metrics — never infer values.

### 3. Guidance Analysis

Build the Guidance Table with columns: Metric | New Guidance | Prior Guidance | Δ | Consensus | vs. Street.

Classify each metric as: **Raised / Maintained / Lowered / Narrowed / Initiated / Withdrawn**.

Quantify magnitude at midpoint: "$150M raise at midpoint, +2.1% vs prior guide" — not just "guidance was raised."

### 4. Segment & KPI Deep Dive

Extract segment-level disclosures and map to industry-relevant KPIs.

#### Industry KPI Matrix

| Vertical | Key KPIs |
|---|---|
| **SaaS / Cloud** | ARR, NRR/NDR, RPO/cRPO, CAC payback, gross retention, logo adds, DBE |
| **Retail / Consumer** | Same-store sales, comp growth, inventory turns, store count Δ, e-commerce mix |
| **Banks / Financials** | NIM, provision for credit losses, CET1 ratio, loan growth, deposit costs, NCO rate |
| **Industrials** | Book-to-bill, backlog, organic growth, price vs volume, input cost trends |
| **Pharma / Biotech** | Pipeline milestones, Rx volume, pricing/reimbursement, patent cliffs, R&D % of revenue |
| **Semiconductors** | Design wins, wafer utilization, ASP trends, inventory days, lead times |
| **Media / Streaming** | Subscriber adds/churn, ARPU, content spend, ad revenue mix |

For each reported segment, produce a mini-table: Segment | Revenue | YoY Δ | Margin | Commentary (use direct management language in commentary).

### 5. Management Sentiment & Tone

Score on a 5-point scale across four dimensions — overall confidence, demand environment, margin outlook, competitive positioning — each supported by a direct quote.

- **Hedging language flags**: Track frequency of "we believe," "we expect," "cautiously optimistic." Compare to prior quarter if available.
- **Tone shifts**: Explicitly call out language-strength changes vs. prior quarter (e.g., "shifted from 'confident' to 'cautiously optimistic' on enterprise demand").
- **Forward-looking statements**: Note material claims but flag as subject to safe-harbor provisions. Do not treat as commitments.

### 6. Analyst Q&A Extraction

Structure each exchange with columns: # | Analyst (Firm) | Topic | Key Takeaway | New Info? | Evasion Flag.

- **New Information**: Flag any Q&A disclosure absent from prepared remarks — this is where alpha lives.
- **Evasion Detection**: Flag non-answers, redirects, or vague language. Evasion on a topic is itself a signal.
- **Follow-up patterns**: Note when multiple analysts pressed on the same topic — indicates Street-level concern.

### 7. Capital Allocation & Balance Sheet

Tabulate: share repurchases, dividends, net debt/EBITDA, M&A commentary, and CapEx — each with current quarter, prior quarter, and commentary.

### 8. Risks & Watchlist

Compile from three sources:
- **Management-disclosed**: Macro, regulatory, supply chain, FX, competitive.
- **Q&A-implied**: Topics where multiple analysts pushed or management evaded.
- **Data-inferred**: Decelerating growth, margin compression, rising DSO.

Tag each item: `[HIGH]` `[MEDIUM]` `[LOW]`.

## Output

Assemble the final summary in this order:

1. **Header**: Ticker, Company, Quarter, Date, Call Duration
2. **TL;DR** (3–5 bullets): Most investable takeaways — what changed, what surprised
3. **Financial Snapshot Table** (Step 2)
4. **Guidance Table** (Step 3)
5. **Segment & KPI Detail** (Step 4)
6. **Management Tone** (Step 5)
7. **Analyst Q&A Highlights** (Step 6)
8. **Capital Allocation** (Step 7)
9. **Risks & Watchlist** (Step 8)
10. **Appendix**: GAAP/Non-GAAP reconciliation notes, definitions of non-standard KPIs

After presenting the draft, ask the user to verify: completeness of metrics, emphasis balance across sections, accuracy of consensus/guidance figures (highest error-risk fields), sentiment scoring alignment, and formatting for their distribution workflow.

## Quality Checks

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| 1 | Every reported metric cites GAAP or Non-GAAP basis |
| 2 | Beat/miss framing uses user-provided consensus — never fabricated estimates |
| 3 | Guidance deltas quantified at midpoint, not just directional |
| 4 | No forward-looking statement presented as a commitment or fact |
| 5 | Analyst names and firms attributed where identifiable |
| 6 | Evasion flags supported by specific non-answer quotes |
| 7 | YoY and QoQ deltas use consistent basis (same quarter, same metric definition) |
| 8 | Industry-specific KPIs match the company's actual vertical |
| 9 | Risks section includes at least one item from each source (disclosed, Q&A-implied, data-inferred) |
| 10 | `[VERIFY]` tags attached to any data point sourced from inference rather than explicit transcript text |
| 11 | No material Q&A information omitted from summary |
| 12 | Compliance disclaimer present if output will be distributed externally |
| 13 | No editorializing without quoted evidence ("management sounded defensive" requires a supporting quote) |
| 14 | Escalate to human review when transcript is partial, has audio-to-text artifacts, or uses unusual reporting frameworks |
