# Managing Radiation Dose

Tracks and optimizes radiation exposure using reference levels and ALARA principles.

## Why This Skill Exists

Medical imaging is the largest source of man-made radiation exposure, with the average annual per-capita effective dose from medical imaging in the U.S. exceeding 3 mSv. CT alone accounts for approximately 75% of medical radiation dose despite representing only 15% of imaging volume. The linear no-threshold (LNT) model, endorsed by the NCRP and ICRP, assumes any radiation dose carries some cancer risk, making dose optimization a professional and regulatory obligation.

The ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) is mandated by the NRC, state radiation protection agencies, and ACR accreditation standards. The ACR Dose Index Registry (DIR) provides national benchmarks (diagnostic reference levels, or DRLs) against which facilities compare their dose performance. CMS Conditions of Participation require dose documentation, and The Joint Commission has recognized diagnostic radiation as a sentinel event trigger when doses exceed expected thresholds. This skill provides the systematic framework for dose monitoring, optimization, documentation, and reporting required by these standards.

## Checkpoint A: Pre-Draft Intake (Mandatory)

1. **What is the dose metric being assessed?** (Default: CTDIvol and DLP for CT; DAP for fluoroscopy; entrance skin dose for radiography)
2. **What exam type is being evaluated?** (Default: Specify — CT head, CT chest, fluoroscopy procedure, etc.)
3. **What is the institutional dose reference level for this exam?** (Default: Obtain from ACR DIR or institutional DRL table)
4. **Is this an individual patient dose review or a protocol optimization assessment?** (Default: Individual patient review)
5. **Is the patient pediatric?** (Default: Adult — pediatric requires stricter dose attention)
6. **Are dose-tracking software reports available (e.g., Radimetrics, DoseWatch)?** (Default: Obtain from dose-tracking system)
7. **Has this exam type exceeded institutional DRLs?** (Default: Compare current dose to reference)

### Documents to Request

- Dose report from scanner (CTDIvol, DLP, SSDE for CT; DAP for fluoroscopy)
- Institutional DRL table for the specific exam type
- ACR DIR benchmark data (50th and 75th percentile) for the exam type
- Patient body size indicator (SSDE for CT; weight for fluoroscopy)
- Dose-tracking software summary (if available)
- Protocol parameters (kVp, mAs, pitch, scan length, number of phases)
- Prior dose data for trending (if optimization project)

## Step 1: Understand Radiation Dose Metrics

### CT Dose Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Clinical Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **CTDIvol** (mGy) | Average dose per slice, normalized by phantom size | Compare protocols; scanner output metric |
| **DLP** (mGy·cm) | CTDIvol × scan length | Total dose for the exam; basis for effective dose estimation |
| **SSDE** (mGy) | Size-specific dose estimate — CTDIvol adjusted for patient size | Most accurate individual patient dose; accounts for body habitus |
| **Effective dose** (mSv) | DLP × conversion factor (k) | Approximates whole-body stochastic risk; used for patient counseling |

### Effective Dose Conversion Factors (k)

| Body Region | k Factor (mSv / mGy·cm) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Head | 0.0021 |
| Neck | 0.0059 |
| Chest | 0.014 |
| Abdomen | 0.015 |
| Pelvis | 0.015 |

### Fluoroscopy Dose Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| **DAP** (Gy·cm²) | Dose-area product: total beam output × field area |
| **Cumulative air kerma** (mGy) | Dose at the interventional reference point (IRP) |
| **Fluoroscopy time** (min) | Total beam-on time; correlate with DAP |
| **Skin dose threshold** | >2 Gy: possible skin erythema; >5 Gy: likely skin injury |

---

## Step 2: Compare Against Diagnostic Reference Levels

### ACR DIR National Reference Levels (Selected Exams)

| CT Exam | 50th Percentile CTDIvol (mGy) | 75th Percentile (DRL) CTDIvol (mGy) | 50th Percentile DLP (mGy·cm) | 75th DRL DLP (mGy·cm) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| CT Head | 51 | 60 | 860 | 1050 |
| CT Chest | 8 | 12 | 310 | 470 |
| CT Abdomen/Pelvis | 11 | 15 | 510 | 720 |
| CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis | 10 | 14 | 650 | 950 |
| CT Lumbar Spine | 20 | 30 | 530 | 780 |

**If institutional dose exceeds the 75th percentile DRL:**
1. Review protocol parameters for optimization opportunities
2. Ensure size-based protocols are applied (not one-size-fits-all)
3. Verify automatic exposure control (AEC) is functioning correctly
4. Consider reducing number of phases (eliminate non-contributing phases)
5. Document review and corrective actions in quality-improvement records

## Step 3: Dose Optimization Strategies

### CT Dose Reduction Techniques

| Technique | Expected Reduction | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Reduce kVp** (120 → 100 or 80) | 30–50% dose reduction | Effective for thin patients and CTA; increased noise in obese patients |
| **Automatic exposure control (AEC)** | 20–40% reduction | Must be properly calibrated; set appropriate noise index |
| **Iterative reconstruction** | 25–50% reduction vs. FBP | Allows lower mAs without increased noise; model-based IR (MBIR) most effective |
| **Reduce scan length** | Proportional to length reduction | Do not extend beyond anatomy of interest; avoid "scout and scan" mismatch |
| **Reduce number of phases** | Proportional to phases eliminated | Single-phase CT often sufficient; eliminate non-contributory pre-contrast or delayed phases |
| **Increase pitch** | Proportional to pitch increase | Faster scan; may reduce spatial resolution |
| **Organ-based tube current modulation** | 20–30% reduction to specific organs | Protects breasts, thyroid, lens — available on newer scanners |
| **Shielding** | Variable | Bismuth shields for breast/thyroid — controversial with AEC; verify no artifact |

### Pediatric-Specific Dose Reduction

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Image Gently campaign** | Size-based protocols mandatory; never use adult parameters |
| **Weight-based kVp** | <50 kg: 80 kVp; 50–80 kg: 100 kVp; >80 kg: 120 kVp |
| **Weight-based mAs** | Per scanner-specific pediatric protocol table |
| **Limit phases** | Single-phase CT whenever possible; avoid multiphase |
| **Alternative modality** | Ultrasound or MRI preferred when diagnostically equivalent |

## Step 4: Dose Documentation and Reporting

### Patient-Level Documentation

Every CT report should include (per ACR standards):
- CTDIvol (mGy)
- DLP (mGy·cm)
- SSDE (mGy) when available
- Number of series/phases

### Dose Alert Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Single exam exceeds institutional DRL by >50% | Real-time alert to supervising radiologist; review justification |
| Single exam exceeds DRL by >100% | Immediate protocol review; document rationale (e.g., large body habitus, repeat acquisition due to motion) |
| Fluoroscopy cumulative air kerma >2 Gy | Alert proceduralist; document skin dose and patient notification |
| Fluoroscopy cumulative air kerma >5 Gy | Patient follow-up required; document in medical record; notify referring provider |
| Pediatric dose exceeds age-appropriate DRL | Mandatory protocol review within 24 hours |

### Regulatory Reporting Requirements

| Requirement | Authority | Detail |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Dose documentation in report | ACR, CMS | CTDIvol and DLP per series/study |
| Dose registry participation | ACR DIR | Quarterly or continuous data submission |
| Significant dose event reporting | State radiation protection | Varies by state; typically triggered by high-dose alerts |
| Sentinel event reporting | Joint Commission | If dose causes patient harm |
| Equipment quality control | State/FDA | Annual physicist survey; dose output verification |

## Step 5: Quality Improvement Program

### Dose Monitoring Program Components

1. **Dose-tracking software** — Automated capture of dose data from all scanners
2. **Dashboard review** — Monthly review of exam-type dose distributions
3. **Outlier identification** — Flag exams >75th percentile DRL
4. **Root-cause analysis** — For outliers: protocol error, patient size, repeat acquisitions, or equipment malfunction
5. **Protocol optimization** — Quarterly review of high-volume exam protocols
6. **Benchmarking** — Compare institutional data to ACR DIR and peer institutions
7. **Training** — Annual technologist education on dose optimization techniques
8. **Reporting** — Quarterly dose report to radiology quality committee

---

## Checkpoint B: Post-Draft Alignment (Mandatory)

1. Are dose metrics (CTDIvol, DLP, SSDE) documented for the study?
2. Is the dose compared against the appropriate DRL for the exam type?
3. Are dose optimization opportunities identified and documented?
4. Is pediatric dose management addressed with size-specific protocols?
5. Are dose alerts triggered and appropriately escalated?

- [ ] Dose-tracking software captures data from all scanner platforms
- [ ] Quarterly dose reports are generated and reviewed by quality committee
- [ ] ACR DIR benchmarking data is current and compared
- [ ] Patient notification is documented when fluoroscopy skin dose exceeds 2 Gy

## Guidelines

1. Apply the ALARA principle to every imaging decision — the best dose reduction is eliminating unnecessary imaging entirely.
2. Use size-specific protocols — a single adult protocol applied to a pediatric patient or thin adult delivers unnecessary radiation.
3. Reduce kVp before reducing mAs for contrast-enhanced studies — lower kVp increases iodine conspicuity and can improve image quality while reducing dose.
4. Never add scan phases "just in case" — each additional phase doubles the radiation dose. Every phase must have a specific clinical justification.
5. Participate in the ACR Dose Index Registry to benchmark institutional performance against national data.
6. For fluoroscopy-guided procedures, track cumulative air kerma in real-time and alert the proceduralist at 2 Gy and 5 Gy thresholds per ACR/SIR guidelines.
7. Dose optimization is a continuous process — review protocols at least quarterly and whenever new reconstruction algorithms or scanner technology become available.
