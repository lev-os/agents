# Managing Investor Portal Content

## When To Use

- Setting up or restructuring an investor portal's document library for a fund or fund family
- Defining access-permission tiers so each LP sees only what they are entitled to (side-letter–specific terms, co-invest materials, etc.)
- Organizing quarterly/annual reporting packages, K-1s, capital-call notices, and distribution notices for retrieval
- Archiving investor correspondence (consent solicitations, LPAC meeting materials, ad-hoc updates) in a searchable structure
- Onboarding a new fund administrator or migrating portal content between platforms

## Inputs To Gather

- **Fund structure details**: fund name(s), vintage year(s), number of active vehicles, feeder/master/parallel relationships
- **LP roster**: investor names, commitment amounts, investor class (institutional, HNW, ERISA, tax-exempt), side-letter provisions affecting document access
- **Document inventory**: list of existing documents with types (PPM, LPA/amendments, subscription docs, financial statements, capital-account statements, K-1s, capital-call/distribution notices, valuation reports, ESG/DEI reports)
- **Permission requirements**: which LP classes or individual LPs receive restricted documents (e.g., advisory-committee materials, co-invest term sheets, side-letter schedules)
- **Regulatory and compliance constraints**: SEC marketing rule considerations, ILPA reporting standards adoption, any data-residency requirements [VERIFY]
- **Portal platform**: name and version of portal software (e.g., Intralinks, iLevel, Juniper Square, Allvue) and any platform-specific folder/tag conventions

## Workflow

1. **Define the folder taxonomy**
   - Top level: organize by fund vehicle (Fund I, Fund II, Co-Invest Vehicle A)
   - Second level: standard categories — Governing Documents, Financial Reporting, Tax Documents, Capital Activity, Valuations, Correspondence, ESG/Impact
   - Third level: time-period folders (by fiscal year or quarter) within reporting categories
   - Create a naming convention spec: `[FundShortName]_[DocType]_[Period]_[Version]` (e.g., `FundII_CapCall_2026Q1_v1`)

2. **Map access-permission tiers**
   - Tier 1 — All LPs: LPA, PPM, audited financials, capital-account statements, K-1s, capital-call/distribution notices
   - Tier 2 — LPAC/Advisory Committee members: LPAC meeting minutes, conflict-waiver requests, valuation-committee materials
   - Tier 3 — Co-invest participants: co-invest term sheets, deal-specific due-diligence memos
   - Tier 4 — Individual LP: side-letter schedules, bespoke fee arrangements, MFN election results
   - Document each tier in a permission matrix (LP name × document category × read/download rights)
   - [VERIFY] Confirm that side-letter MFN provisions do not require broader disclosure of certain restricted documents

3. **Upload and tag documents**
   - Batch-upload documents into the taxonomy; apply metadata tags (document type, reporting period, fund vehicle, confidentiality level)
   - Validate file integrity (page count, correct fund name on cover, watermark if required)
   - Set per-document or per-folder permissions according to the permission matrix
   - Enable version control: superseded documents marked as archived, current version flagged as active

4. **Organize the communication archive**
   - Create a Correspondence folder per fund with sub-folders: Consent Solicitations, LPAC Communications, Ad-Hoc Notices, Annual Meeting Materials
   - Index each communication by date, subject, and recipient list
   - Link related documents (e.g., a consent solicitation linked to the relevant LPA amendment)

5. **Test and validate access**
   - Log in as a sample LP from each permission tier and confirm correct document visibility
   - Verify that restricted documents (Tier 2–4) are invisible to unauthorized LPs
   - Confirm download/print restrictions function if configured
   - Check notification settings: LPs should receive email alerts when new documents are posted

6. **Establish maintenance cadence**
   - Define posting SLAs (e.g., quarterly reports within 60 days of quarter-end, K-1s by March 15 [VERIFY local deadline])
   - Assign responsibility: IR team posts reporting packages; fund admin uploads capital-activity notices; legal posts governing-document amendments
   - Schedule quarterly audit of portal content for completeness, broken links, and permission accuracy

## Output

Produce a **Portal Content Management Plan** containing:

- **Folder taxonomy diagram** showing the full hierarchy per fund vehicle
- **Permission matrix** mapping each LP (or LP class) to document-category access rights
- **Naming convention guide** with examples for each document type
- **Communication archive index** listing archived correspondence with metadata
- **Posting-responsibility matrix** assigning document types to responsible teams with SLA deadlines
- **Quarterly audit checklist** for ongoing content verification

## Quality Checks

- Every document in the inventory has been placed in exactly one folder location and tagged with correct metadata
- Permission matrix accounts for all side-letter provisions that expand or restrict access [VERIFY]
- Naming convention is applied consistently — no ad-hoc file names remain
- Communication archive entries include date, subject, sender, and recipient list
- Posting SLAs align with fund LPA requirements and ILPA best-practice timelines [VERIFY]
- Portal access has been tested from at least one LP account per permission tier
- No confidential documents (side letters, fee arrangements) are visible to unauthorized parties
