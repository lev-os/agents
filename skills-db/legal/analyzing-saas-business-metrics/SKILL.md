# Analyzing Saas Business Metrics

Deconstructs SaaS operating metrics including ARR, NRR, gross retention, magic number, rule of 40, and cohort economics.

## When To Use

- Evaluating a SaaS company for growth equity or late-stage investment
- Benchmarking a portfolio company's operating metrics against peer cohorts
- Assessing subscription model health during due diligence or quarterly reviews
- Analyzing expansion revenue dynamics and churn trends for board-level reporting
- Comparing "efficient growth" profiles across competing deal opportunities

## Inputs To Gather

- **Revenue data**: Monthly or quarterly MRR/ARR schedules covering at least 12–24 months; breakdown by new, expansion, contraction, and churned revenue
- **Customer data**: Beginning-of-period and end-of-period customer counts by cohort (sign-up quarter or ACV tier); logo churn counts
- **Expense data**: Fully loaded S&M spend by quarter (including headcount costs); COGS broken out to show hosting, support, and CS costs separately
- **Cohort schedules**: Revenue by vintage cohort showing retention and expansion over time (ideally 8+ quarterly cohorts)
- **Billing & contract details**: Contract term mix (monthly vs. annual vs. multi-year), average ACV, and gross-to-net revenue adjustments
- **Context**: Industry vertical, target customer segment (SMB/mid-market/enterprise), and pricing model (seat-based, usage-based, platform fee)

## Workflow

1. **Validate the ARR bridge**
   - Reconstruct ARR from Beginning ARR + New + Expansion − Contraction − Churn = Ending ARR
   - Confirm each component ties to underlying MRR schedules; flag any reconciliation gaps with [VERIFY]
   - Distinguish between committed ARR and run-rate ARR if usage-based revenue is material

2. **Calculate core retention metrics**
   - **Gross Dollar Retention (GDR)**: (Beginning ARR − Contraction − Churn) / Beginning ARR. Healthy benchmark: >90% for enterprise, >80% for SMB [VERIFY against current market benchmarks]
   - **Net Dollar Retention (NDR/NRR)**: (Beginning ARR + Expansion − Contraction − Churn) / Beginning ARR. Best-in-class: >120% enterprise, >110% mid-market
   - **Logo retention**: 1 − (churned logos / beginning logos). Separate from dollar retention to isolate unit economics from mix effects
   - Note whether retention is calculated on a trailing-12-month basis or quarterly annualized — results differ materially

3. **Assess growth efficiency**
   - **Magic Number**: Net New ARR (current quarter) / S&M Spend (prior quarter). Targets: >0.75 indicates efficient spend; >1.0 is strong; <0.5 signals concern
   - **CAC Payback**: Fully loaded S&M per new customer / (new ARR per customer × gross margin). Express in months; <18 months is generally attractive for enterprise SaaS
   - **LTV/CAC**: (ARR per customer × gross margin) / (1 − GDR) / CAC. Minimum threshold typically >3x
   - Separate new-logo acquisition efficiency from expansion-driven growth — blended metrics can mask deteriorating new-business economics

4. **Evaluate profitability and the Rule of 40**
   - Rule of 40 = YoY ARR growth rate (%) + FCF margin (%) or EBITDA margin (%). Score ≥40 is the benchmark; identify which component is driving the result
   - Break out **gross margin** (target >70% for pure SaaS, >60% if managed services are included [VERIFY]). Scrutinize hosting costs, capitalized development, and professional services pass-throughs
   - Examine operating leverage: is S&M as a % of revenue declining as revenue scales? Is G&A staying flat or growing?

5. **Analyze cohort economics**
   - Build a cohort waterfall: for each vintage, show cumulative revenue as a multiple of first-period revenue at 4, 8, 12, and 16+ quarters
   - Identify whether newer cohorts retain and expand at the same rate as older ones — declining cohort quality is a red flag
   - Calculate **cohort payback**: quarters until cumulative gross profit from a cohort exceeds the S&M cost to acquire it
   - Flag if expansion is concentrated in a small number of large accounts vs. broad-based

6. **Benchmark and contextualize**
   - Compare all key metrics against relevant public SaaS comps and private benchmarks (e.g., Bessemer Cloud Index, ICONIQ Growth reports, KeyBanc SaaS survey) [VERIFY data sources are current]
   - Adjust for company stage (e.g., $10M ARR vs. $100M ARR expectations differ), end-market, and contract structure
   - Highlight where the company is top-quartile, median, or below-median on each metric

## Output

Produce a structured SaaS Metrics Analysis containing:

- **Executive summary**: 3–5 sentence assessment of subscription model health and growth quality
- **ARR bridge table**: Quarterly ARR waterfall with all components for the trailing 8+ quarters
- **Retention dashboard**: GDR, NDR, and logo retention trended over time with commentary on drivers
- **Efficiency scorecard**: Magic number, CAC payback, LTV/CAC, and Rule of 40 — each with a benchmark comparison
- **Cohort matrix**: Vintage cohort retention/expansion grid with visual highlighting of trends
- **Key findings**: Bulleted list of 5–10 specific observations (strengths, risks, and areas requiring further diligence)
- **Open items**: Any metrics that could not be calculated due to missing data, marked [VERIFY]

## Quality Checks

- ARR bridge reconciles to within 1% of reported ending ARR; any variance is explained
- Retention metrics are calculated on a consistent basis (same period definition) throughout
- Magic number uses prior-quarter S&M spend (not same-quarter) to reflect the sales cycle lag
- Gross margin excludes capitalized software development costs unless explicitly noted
- Cohort analysis covers enough vintages (minimum 4) to identify trend vs. noise
- All benchmark comparisons cite the source and vintage of the benchmark data
- No metric is presented without context — raw numbers always accompanied by what "good" looks like for the company's stage and segment
- Assumptions about annualization, seasonality adjustments, or pro-forma treatments are stated explicitly
