# Managing Contact Tracing

## Why This Skill Exists

Contact tracing is the systematic identification and follow-up of persons who may have been exposed to an infectious agent through close contact with a confirmed or probable case. It is one of the oldest and most effective tools in communicable disease control — foundational for TB, STIs, Ebola, mpox, and respiratory pathogens including COVID-19. Effective contact tracing interrupts transmission chains, provides prophylaxis or early treatment to exposed individuals, and generates critical epidemiologic intelligence about transmission patterns. The scale and complexity of contact tracing operations — from a single TB index case with 15 contacts to a COVID-19 surge with thousands of daily cases — demand structured operational management. This skill codifies the operational framework used by CDC, NACCHO, and ASTHO for running contact tracing programs.


Contact tracing program design must account for disease-specific parameters, community trust dynamics, technology infrastructure, and workforce capacity. The lessons from COVID-19 contact tracing at scale — including workforce surge models, digital contact notification tools, and equity-focused outreach — have permanently expanded the operational toolkit for infectious disease response.

## Checkpoint A — Intake and Scoping

### Intake Questions

1. What disease or pathogen is the target of contact tracing? (Determines infectious period, close-contact definition, and monitoring duration.)
2. What is the current case volume — daily new cases requiring investigation?
3. What case management system is in use (CommCare, Salesforce, Sara Alert, state-built system)?
4. What is the staffing model — FTE contact tracers, surge workforce, volunteers, contracted vendors?
5. What is the contact-tracing-to-case ratio target? (CDC recommended 15:1 for COVID-19 peak operations.)
6. What languages are spoken in the affected population? Are bilingual tracers available?
7. What legal authorities exist for isolation and quarantine orders in this jurisdiction?
8. Are post-exposure prophylaxis or vaccination available for contacts (e.g., Doxy-PEP for STIs, ring vaccination for mpox)?

### Required Documents

- CDC disease-specific contact tracing guidance (e.g., CDC COVID-19 Contact Tracing guidance, DTBE TB contact investigation guidelines)
- Jurisdiction's isolation and quarantine orders or statutes
- Case investigation interview script and contact elicitation form
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the contact tracing program
- Training curriculum and competency checklist for contact tracers
- Data-sharing agreements between health department, labs, and healthcare facilities
- Metrics dashboard or reporting template

## Step 1 — Case Investigation and Interview

Within 24 hours of case notification (target for most conditions):

- Assign case to an investigator based on language, geography, or caseload balancing.
- Conduct the case investigation interview using the standardized script. Collect: symptom onset date, symptoms, clinical status, household composition, and high-risk settings (workplace, school, congregate facility).
- Determine the **infectious period** based on disease-specific parameters (e.g., 2 days before symptom onset through 10 days after for COVID-19; symptom onset through sputum culture conversion for TB).
- Elicit all close contacts during the infectious period. Define "close contact" per disease-specific guidance (e.g., within 6 feet for ≥15 cumulative minutes in 24 hours for COVID-19; shared air space for TB).
- Assess case's ability to isolate: housing, food access, employment, insurance. Refer to social support services as needed.
- Issue isolation instructions per jurisdictional authority. Document verbal or written acknowledgment.

- **Equity-focused case investigation** --- Train investigators in culturally humble, trauma-informed interview techniques. Provide interpretation services (not family members) for non-English speakers. Address barriers to isolation (housing, food, employment) during the investigation, not as an afterthought. Document and track equity metrics: case investigation completion rates and timeliness by race/ethnicity, language, and geography
---

## Step 2 — Contact Identification and Notification

- Enter all identified contacts into the case management system with: name, relationship to case, contact information, exposure date(s), exposure setting, and risk tier.
- Prioritize notification by risk tier:
  - **Priority 1**: Household contacts, intimate partners, healthcare workers without PPE, immunocompromised persons.
  - **Priority 2**: Close contacts in congregate settings (correctional, shelter, long-term care).
  - **Priority 3**: Community contacts meeting the close-contact definition.
- Attempt contact notification within 24 hours of identification (48 hours maximum before escalation).
- During notification, never disclose the identity of the index case to the contact. Provide: disease information, exposure date, recommended actions (testing, quarantine, monitoring, prophylaxis).
- Document each notification attempt with date, time, method (phone, text, field visit), and outcome.

## Step 3 — Contact Monitoring and Support

- Assign each contact a monitoring protocol based on disease-specific guidance:
  - **Active monitoring**: Daily check-in by tracer (phone, text, app-based) for symptom development. Required for high-consequence pathogens (Ebola, MERS).
  - **Direct active monitoring**: Daily in-person observation by health department. Used for quarantined contacts of high-consequence pathogens.
  - **Self-monitoring with check-in**: Contact self-monitors and reports symptoms; tracer checks in at defined intervals. Standard for COVID-19, STI exposure.
- Monitoring duration = maximum incubation period from last exposure date.
- If contact develops symptoms, escalate to testing and case investigation immediately. Reclassify as suspected/probable case.
- Provide quarantine support: food assistance referrals, employment protection information, mental health resources, and medical evaluation access.

- **Technology-assisted monitoring** --- Implement technology tools to augment human monitoring capacity: automated text-based symptom check-in systems (Sara Alert, CommCare), temperature monitoring with reporting apps, GPS-based proximity notification (GAEN framework), and dashboard-based contact management for supervisors. Technology supplements but does not replace human-to-human contact tracing communication

## Step 4 — Operational Metrics and Quality Management

Track and report the following metrics at least weekly:

- **Timeliness**: Median time from case report to case interview initiation (target: < 24 hours).
- **Timeliness**: Median time from contact identification to contact notification (target: < 24 hours).
- **Completeness**: Percentage of cases with completed interviews (target: ≥ 80%).
- **Yield**: Average number of contacts elicited per case.
- **Reach**: Percentage of identified contacts successfully notified (target: ≥ 75%).
- **Conversion**: Percentage of contacts who complete the full monitoring period.
- **Positivity**: Percentage of contacts who become confirmed cases (indicates ongoing transmission).

Use these metrics to adjust staffing levels, identify bottlenecks (e.g., unreachable contacts), and demonstrate program value to funders and leadership.

## Step 5 — Cluster and Congregate Setting Management

When contact tracing reveals a cluster:

- Aggregate contacts by setting (school, workplace, facility) and assess for common-source or propagated transmission.
- Coordinate with facility management for on-site testing, enhanced cleaning, and cohorting where applicable.
- For congregate settings (correctional facilities, shelters, long-term care), implement facility-wide testing and serial testing per CDC guidance.
- For school settings, follow CDC K-12 operational guidance and consult school health liaisons.
- For healthcare facilities, coordinate with infection prevention (IP) teams and assess for healthcare-associated transmission.

- **Workforce resilience and retention** --- Contact tracing is emotionally demanding work. Implement: regular supervisor debriefing sessions, employee assistance program access, workload management (maximum 20-25 active contacts per tracer), career pathway communication (tracing skills transfer to epidemiology, public health nursing, community health work), and recognition programs for sustained performance

## Guidelines

- Never disclose the identity of an index case to a contact. This is a foundational confidentiality principle of contact tracing and is often codified in state statute.
- Contact tracing is a public health function, not a law enforcement function. Tracers must not share information with immigration, police, or courts except as required by mandatory reporting statutes (e.g., child abuse).
- Cultural humility and trauma-informed interviewing techniques are essential for effective contact elicitation, especially in stigmatized conditions (HIV, STIs, TB in immigrant communities).
- When case volume exceeds tracer capacity, implement a prioritization framework: focus on highest-risk contacts (household, immunocompromised, congregate settings) rather than attempting to trace every community contact incompletely.
- Digital exposure notification tools (GAEN-based apps) supplement but do not replace traditional contact tracing. They address the "unknown contact" gap but have low uptake and require epidemiologic context.
- For TB contact investigations, follow the concentric-circles approach defined in CDC DTBE guidelines: start with highest-risk contacts and expand outward only if infection rates exceed expected background.
- Escalate to supervisory epidemiologist when: a cluster is identified, a superspreader event is suspected, contact positivity rate exceeds 20%, or a contact cannot be located after three attempts across two weeks.

- Contact tracing programs must earn and maintain community trust. In communities with historical reasons for distrust (immigration enforcement, surveillance, discrimination), partnership with trusted community organizations is essential before deploying tracers. Trust is built through action, not messaging.
- Pandemic-scale contact tracing requires different operational design than endemic disease tracing. Surge workforce models, simplified case investigation protocols, technology-assisted monitoring, and priority-based triage become necessary when case volumes exceed traditional capacity. Plan for surge before it is needed.
