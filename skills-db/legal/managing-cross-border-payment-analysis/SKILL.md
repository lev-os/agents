# Managing Cross Border Payment Analysis

Structures cross-border payment evaluation with corridor analysis, pricing, and regulatory requirements.

## When To Use

- Evaluating a new cross-border payment corridor for product launch or expansion
- Benchmarking remittance pricing against competitors for a specific send/receive pair
- Assessing regulatory feasibility of entering a new market or partnering with a local payout provider
- Reviewing an existing corridor's economics (FX spread, fees, settlement costs) for margin optimization
- Performing due diligence on an international payment provider or correspondent banking relationship

## Inputs To Gather

- **Corridor definition**: Send country, receive country, currency pair (e.g., USD→PHP), estimated monthly volume and average transaction size
- **Customer segment**: Consumer remittance, SMB trade payments, enterprise treasury, or marketplace payouts
- **Current pricing data**: Competitor fee schedules, published FX rates, and any available interchange or scheme fees
- **Regulatory landscape**: Licenses held or required in send and receive jurisdictions [VERIFY per jurisdiction]
- **Settlement infrastructure**: Correspondent bank relationships, local payment rails (ACH, RTGS, mobile money), and payout network coverage
- **Risk parameters**: Sanctions screening obligations, fraud rates on corridor, chargeback exposure, and AML typologies specific to the corridor

## Workflow

1. **Define corridor scope**
   - Specify origin/destination countries, currency pair, and directionality (one-way vs. bidirectional)
   - Identify customer segment and use case (remittance, B2B invoice, payroll, marketplace settlement)
   - Set volume assumptions: projected monthly transactions, average ticket size, peak/trough seasonality

2. **Map regulatory requirements**
   - Identify required licenses in the send jurisdiction (e.g., state MTLs in the US, EMI in EU, PSP license in UK) [VERIFY]
   - Identify required licenses or partnerships in the receive jurisdiction (e.g., authorized dealer bank, mobile money operator approval) [VERIFY]
   - Document sanctions and restricted-party screening obligations (OFAC, EU consolidated list, UN sanctions) [VERIFY]
   - Note data localization, reporting thresholds (e.g., CTR at $10K USD equivalent), and consumer disclosure rules [VERIFY]

3. **Analyze pricing and economics**
   - Break down total cost to customer: upfront fee + FX markup + any intermediary charges
   - Benchmark against at least three competitors on the same corridor using published rates or mystery-shop data
   - Calculate unit economics per transaction: revenue (fee + FX spread) minus direct costs (scheme fees, correspondent charges, payout partner fees, compliance cost allocation)
   - Model margin sensitivity to FX volatility — flag corridors where spread exceeds 150 bps or where local currency is illiquid

4. **Evaluate settlement and payout infrastructure**
   - Map available payout methods: bank deposit, mobile wallet, cash pickup, card credit
   - Assess settlement speed: same-day, T+1, T+2 — and identify bottlenecks (cut-off times, correspondent bank processing windows)
   - Evaluate pre-funding requirements and float implications on working capital
   - Identify single points of failure (sole correspondent bank, single payout aggregator)

5. **Assess operational and compliance risk**
   - Score corridor on AML risk (high/medium/low) based on FATF mutual evaluation, Transparency International CPI, and historical SARs filing rates
   - Identify fraud typologies prevalent on the corridor (identity fraud, mule networks, structuring)
   - Review partner due diligence: KYC/KYB on payout agents, ongoing monitoring cadence, contractual audit rights
   - Flag any pending regulatory changes that could affect corridor viability [VERIFY]

6. **Compile corridor assessment report**
   - Summarize go/no-go recommendation with supporting rationale
   - Present pricing comparison table, unit economics model, and sensitivity analysis
   - Include regulatory checklist with license status and timeline to compliance
   - Outline implementation roadmap: partner onboarding, technical integration, testing, and launch milestones

## Output

The deliverable is a **Cross-Border Payment Corridor Assessment Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Corridor viability rating (green/amber/red), key economics, and recommended action
- **Regulatory matrix**: License-by-license status table for send and receive jurisdictions with estimated timelines
- **Pricing benchmark**: Side-by-side comparison of total cost to customer across competitors
- **Unit economics model**: Per-transaction P&L with assumptions clearly stated
- **Settlement architecture diagram**: Flow of funds from send to receive, with intermediaries, cut-off times, and pre-funding nodes
- **Risk scorecard**: AML risk tier, fraud exposure estimate, and operational concentration risk
- **Implementation roadmap**: Phased plan with dependencies, milestones, and estimated launch date

## Quality Checks

- All regulatory requirements are jurisdiction-specific and tagged [VERIFY] where statutes, thresholds, or license names may change
- Pricing benchmarks use data no older than 90 days; any stale data is flagged
- Unit economics model includes all cost layers — no hidden costs omitted (nostro/vostro charges, FX hedging costs, compliance overhead)
- Settlement flow accounts for weekends, holidays, and cut-off times in both jurisdictions
- Sanctions and AML obligations reference the correct regime for each jurisdiction, not generic global statements
- Competitor analysis compares like-for-like (same send amount, same payout method) rather than headline rates
- Report clearly distinguishes confirmed data from estimates or assumptions
