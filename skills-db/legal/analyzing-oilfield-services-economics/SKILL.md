# Analyzing Oilfield Services Economics

Evaluates OFS sector investments by modeling rig count sensitivity, day rate dynamics, fleet utilization, and technology adoption curves across pressure pumping, drilling, completion, and production service segments.

## When To Use

- Underwriting an investment in an oilfield services company (pressure pumping, directional drilling, wireline, coiled tubing, well intervention)
- Assessing how commodity price swings translate into OFS revenue and margin changes
- Modeling day rate recovery or compression scenarios for a specific service line
- Evaluating a technology adoption thesis (e.g., electric frac fleets, rotary steerable systems, automated rigs)
- Benchmarking an OFS target against public comps (HAL, SLB, LBRT, NEX, PTEN, HP)

## Inputs To Gather

- **Target company financials**: Revenue by service line, EBITDA margins, CapEx/maintenance CapEx split, fleet composition and age
- **Rig count data**: Baker Hughes US/Canada/international rig counts (current and trailing 12-month trend); basin-level breakdown if available
- **Day rate / pricing data**: Spot and contracted day rates for relevant service (e.g., frac spread rates, land drilling day rates); historical pricing bands
- **Utilization metrics**: Active vs. stacked fleet count, crew availability, equipment uptime percentages
- **Commodity price assumptions**: WTI, Henry Hub, and basin differentials driving E&P activity levels
- **Technology context**: Adoption stage of key technologies (pilot, early commercial, broad deployment); efficiency gains per unit (e.g., stages/day, footage/day)
- **Contract structure**: Proportion of dedicated/term contracts vs. spot work; take-or-pay minimums; contract rollover schedule

## Workflow

1. **Map the activity chain** — Identify the link between commodity prices, E&P capital budgets, rig count, and the target's specific service demand. Quantify the lag (typically 1-3 quarters from commodity price move to OFS revenue impact). [VERIFY] current lag using latest quarterly earnings commentary.

2. **Build rig count sensitivity** — Model revenue under bear/base/bull rig count scenarios. For each scenario:
   - Estimate addressable rig count by basin where target operates
   - Apply utilization rate assumptions (e.g., 85% base, 70% bear, 95% bull)
   - Multiply by expected revenue per rig/spread/unit to derive top-line range

3. **Analyze day rate dynamics** — Assess where current pricing sits relative to historical bands:
   - Identify the cash breakeven day rate for the target's fleet
   - Determine the replacement-cost day rate (rate needed to justify new-build equipment)
   - Flag whether current rates are above or below mid-cycle norms [VERIFY] with latest IHS/Rystad or earnings call data

4. **Assess fleet economics and CapEx cycle** — Evaluate the target's equipment age, maintenance CapEx burden, and replacement timeline:
   - Calculate maintenance CapEx as % of revenue vs. peers
   - Determine remaining useful life of core fleet assets
   - Model growth CapEx ROI under current day rate assumptions (target IRR threshold typically 20-30% unlevered for new-build)

5. **Model technology adoption impact** — If a technology thesis is central to the investment:
   - Quantify the efficiency or cost advantage (e.g., electric frac: 20-30% fuel cost reduction, higher pumping hours/day)
   - Estimate the current adoption curve position (innovator <5%, early adopter 5-20%, early majority 20-50%)
   - Project how adoption shifts the target's margin profile vs. legacy competitors
   - Identify barriers to adoption (CapEx intensity, operator acceptance, infrastructure constraints)

6. **Run margin and cash flow scenarios** — Build three-case (bear/base/bull) EBITDA and FCF models:
   - Revenue drivers: rig count x utilization x day rate
   - Variable cost structure: crew costs, consumables, mobilization
   - Operating leverage: quantify incremental margins on each additional active unit (typically 50-70% for OFS)
   - FCF conversion: EBITDA less maintenance CapEx, working capital swings, and interest

7. **Benchmark against comps** — Compare key metrics to public OFS peers:
   - EV/EBITDA (current and mid-cycle normalized)
   - Revenue per active unit, EBITDA margin by segment
   - Fleet age, technology mix, contract backlog duration
   - Balance sheet leverage (Net Debt / EBITDA) and liquidity

## Output

Produce an **OFS Investment Analysis** containing:

- **Executive summary**: One-paragraph investment thesis with key risk/reward asymmetry
- **Activity sensitivity table**: Revenue and EBITDA under 3 rig count / day rate scenarios
- **Day rate positioning chart**: Current rate vs. cash breakeven, replacement cost, and 10-year historical range
- **Technology adoption assessment**: Stage of adoption, margin impact, and timeline to inflection
- **Fleet and CapEx analysis**: Equipment age, maintenance burden, growth CapEx ROI
- **Comp benchmarking table**: Target vs. 4-6 public peers across valuation, margins, leverage, and fleet metrics
- **Key risks**: Top 3-5 risks with probability/impact framing (e.g., commodity price collapse, crew shortages, technology obsolescence, contract concentration)

## Quality Checks

- Rig count data sourced from Baker Hughes or equivalent; confirm the reporting date matches the analysis period
- Day rate assumptions cross-referenced against at least two sources (earnings calls, broker reports, industry surveys) [VERIFY]
- Utilization and margin assumptions stress-tested — confirm that bear case does not assume below-historical-trough utilization without justification
- Technology adoption claims supported by operator survey data, earnings commentary, or third-party research (Rystad, Spears & Associates, IHS) [VERIFY]
- Operating leverage assumptions validated against historical incremental margins during prior up/down cycles
- All basin-specific claims verified against actual target operating footprint — do not assume Permian economics apply to Haynesville or Bakken without adjustment [VERIFY]
- Commodity price assumptions stated explicitly and sourced (forward strip, house view, or scenario-defined)
