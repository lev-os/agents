# Managing Payment Compliance

Structures payment regulatory compliance across PCI-DSS, money transmitter licensing (MTL), and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements for fintech and payments businesses.

## When To Use

- Onboarding a new payment product or flow that touches cardholder data, stored value, or funds transfer
- Preparing for or responding to a PCI-DSS assessment (SAQ or ROC)
- Evaluating money transmitter licensing obligations across states or federal MSB registration
- Building or auditing a BSA/AML compliance program for a payments entity
- Coordinating remediation after a compliance gap analysis, audit finding, or regulatory inquiry

## Inputs To Gather

- **Business model details**: Payment flows, transaction types (card-present, card-not-present, ACH, wire, wallet), settlement mechanics, and custodial relationships
- **Current PCI scope**: Cardholder data environment (CDE) diagram, network segmentation documentation, SAQ type or ROC history, ASV scan results
- **Licensing posture**: Existing MTL states, pending applications, exemption claims (agent-of-the-payee, bank partnership/BIN sponsorship), and FinCEN MSB registration status
- **BSA/AML program artifacts**: Written BSA policy, CIP/CDD procedures, suspicious activity monitoring methodology, SAR filing history, independent audit reports
- **Regulatory correspondence**: Any state examiner findings, FinCEN letters, or card brand non-compliance notices
- **Organizational context**: Responsible compliance officer, QSA or external counsel relationships, remediation budget and timeline constraints

## Workflow

1. **Map the regulatory surface**
   - Classify each payment flow against PCI-DSS applicability (does the entity store, process, or transmit cardholder data?)
   - Determine MTL trigger: does the entity receive, transmit, or hold funds on behalf of another party? [VERIFY state-by-state statutory definitions — "money transmission" varies significantly]
   - Confirm FinCEN MSB registration requirement and applicable BSA obligations based on activity type (money transmitter, prepaid access provider, etc.)

2. **Assess PCI-DSS compliance posture**
   - Identify correct SAQ type or confirm ROC requirement based on transaction volume and card brand thresholds [VERIFY current Visa/Mastercard volume thresholds]
   - Review CDE scoping: validate segmentation controls, document all system components in scope
   - Check status of quarterly ASV scans, annual penetration testing, and any compensating controls
   - Flag open items from prior assessments or card brand compliance programs (GRAP, non-compliance fees)

3. **Evaluate MTL licensing status**
   - List all states where the entity operates or has customers; cross-reference against states requiring MTL [VERIFY — state requirements change; confirm against current NMLS data]
   - Assess viability of exemptions: bank partnership model, agent-of-the-payee, payment processor exclusion
   - For pending applications: track surety bond requirements, net worth minimums, background check status, and examiner Q&A cycles
   - Document multi-state renewal calendar and annual reporting obligations

4. **Review BSA/AML program adequacy**
   - Confirm five pillars are in place: (1) written policies, (2) designated compliance officer, (3) training program, (4) independent audit, (5) CIP/CDD procedures
   - Evaluate transaction monitoring rules and thresholds against actual product risk (peer-to-peer, cross-border, high-value)
   - Review SAR filing timeliness and quality; check CTR obligations if cash or cash-equivalent activity exists
   - Assess OFAC screening integration across onboarding and ongoing transaction flows

5. **Build remediation and coordination plan**
   - Prioritize gaps by enforcement risk: items likely to trigger regulatory action or card brand penalties first
   - Assign owners, deadlines, and budget for each remediation item
   - Establish reporting cadence: weekly for active remediation, monthly for steady-state monitoring
   - Define escalation triggers: new state enforcement action, PCI validation deadline, SAR backlog exceeding threshold

## Output

Produce a **Payment Compliance Management Report** containing:

- **Regulatory coverage matrix**: Table mapping each payment flow to applicable PCI-DSS, MTL, and BSA requirements with current compliance status (compliant / gap / in-progress)
- **PCI assessment summary**: SAQ/ROC status, open findings, remediation timeline, next validation deadline
- **MTL licensing tracker**: State-by-state status (licensed / exempt / applied / not yet filed), key dates, and estimated costs
- **BSA program scorecard**: Pillar-by-pillar assessment with red/yellow/green status and specific deficiencies
- **Remediation roadmap**: Prioritized action items with owners, deadlines, dependencies, and estimated cost
- **Risk register**: Outstanding compliance risks ranked by likelihood and severity, with mitigation plans

## Quality Checks

- Every compliance gap cites the specific requirement it maps to (e.g., PCI-DSS Req. 3.4, state statute section, 31 CFR 1022)
- MTL analysis accounts for both the entity's domicile state and all states where customers reside [VERIFY whether the entity uses a nationwide licensing approach or targeted filing strategy]
- PCI scope is validated against current network architecture — not stale documentation
- BSA risk assessment reflects actual transaction data and customer demographics, not boilerplate
- All jurisdiction-specific requirements, exemption eligibility claims, and regulatory thresholds are marked with [VERIFY] where they may have changed since last review
- Report distinguishes between confirmed compliance status and self-assessed status not yet validated by examiner or QSA
