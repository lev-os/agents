# Analyzing Factor Timing Signals

Evaluates factor timing strategies by combining macro regime indicators, valuation spreads, and momentum signals to inform tactical factor rotation decisions across equity portfolios.

## When To Use

- Assessing whether to tilt portfolio exposure toward value, momentum, quality, low-volatility, or size factors
- Evaluating current macro regime (expansion, slowdown, contraction, recovery) and its historical factor implications
- Analyzing valuation spread compression or expansion across factor long/short portfolios
- Designing or backtesting a systematic factor rotation framework
- Reviewing existing factor timing models for signal decay, overfitting, or regime sensitivity

## Inputs To Gather

- **Factor return series**: Long/short returns for target factors (e.g., HML, UMD, QMJ, BAB, SMB) — minimum 15–20 years for regime analysis
- **Macro regime indicators**: Yield curve slope, ISM/PMI readings, credit spreads (IG and HY OAS), unemployment rate trajectory, leading economic index [VERIFY: confirm indicator availability and publication lag for chosen geography]
- **Valuation spread data**: Cross-sectional spread between cheap and expensive quintiles on book-to-market, earnings yield, or composite value scores
- **Factor momentum signals**: Trailing 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month factor returns; time-series momentum (absolute) and cross-sectional momentum (relative ranking)
- **Sentiment and positioning data** (optional): CFTC futures positioning, fund flow data, factor crowding estimates (e.g., short-interest ratios in factor tails)
- **Benchmark and universe specification**: Which equity universe (e.g., Russell 1000, MSCI World) and rebalancing frequency

## Workflow

1. **Classify the current macro regime**
   - Map macro indicators to a regime taxonomy (e.g., growth accelerating/decelerating × inflation rising/falling)
   - Compare current readings against historical percentiles
   - Identify which factors have historically outperformed in analogous regimes (e.g., value tends to lead in early recovery; momentum in mid-cycle expansion) [VERIFY: regime-factor mappings against your own backtest data — published relationships vary by sample period]

2. **Evaluate valuation spreads**
   - Compute the current valuation spread for each target factor relative to its own history (z-score or percentile rank)
   - Wide spreads suggest higher expected returns for the cheap-minus-expensive leg; compressed spreads signal reduced forward premium
   - Flag factors where spreads have reached extreme deciles (top/bottom 10%) — these are candidates for tactical overweight or underweight

3. **Assess factor momentum signals**
   - Calculate time-series momentum: is the factor return positive over trailing windows (1M, 3M, 12M-1M)?
   - Calculate cross-sectional momentum: rank factors by recent return; top-ranked factors receive tilt
   - Check for momentum reversals — sharp drawdowns following extended positive runs often indicate crowding unwinds

4. **Construct composite timing score**
   - Assign weights to regime, valuation, and momentum signal pillars (common starting point: equal weight across pillars, then adjust based on backtest evidence)
   - For each factor, produce a combined z-score or ranked score
   - Apply signal smoothing (e.g., 1-month exponential moving average) to reduce turnover from noisy signals

5. **Stress-test and validate**
   - Run out-of-sample or walk-forward backtest of the composite signal against naive equal-factor allocation and static tilts
   - Measure information ratio, hit rate, and max drawdown of the timing strategy versus the baseline
   - Test sensitivity to signal lag (publication delay of macro data) and transaction costs at assumed turnover levels
   - Check for look-ahead bias in valuation spread construction and regime classification

6. **Formulate rotation recommendation**
   - Translate composite scores into portfolio tilts (e.g., overweight factors scoring above +0.5σ, underweight below −0.5σ, neutral otherwise)
   - Specify tilt magnitude ranges and maximum single-factor concentration limits
   - State the recommended rebalancing cadence and signal review schedule

## Output

- **Regime assessment**: Current macro regime classification with supporting indicator readings
- **Factor signal dashboard**: Table showing each factor's valuation spread percentile, momentum readings (1M/3M/12M), and composite timing score
- **Rotation recommendation**: Clear overweight/neutral/underweight call per factor, with tilt sizing guidance
- **Backtest summary**: Key performance statistics (IR, Sharpe, turnover, max drawdown) of the timing strategy versus static and equal-weight baselines
- **Risk and limitations note**: Identified model risks including signal crowding, regime misclassification probability, and data lag effects

## Quality Checks

- Confirm factor return data aligns with a consistent construction methodology (same universe, same rebalancing frequency) across the entire sample
- Verify macro regime dates against NBER or equivalent cycle dating for the relevant economy [VERIFY: use jurisdiction-appropriate cycle dating authority]
- Ensure valuation spread calculations use point-in-time data — no survivorship or look-ahead bias in book value or earnings inputs
- Validate that momentum signals are computed on non-overlapping periods when used jointly (avoid double-counting the most recent month)
- Confirm transaction cost assumptions reflect realistic market impact for the portfolio size and rebalancing frequency specified
- Cross-check composite signal weights — if optimized in-sample, report both in-sample and out-of-sample results separately
- Flag any factor where fewer than three full macro cycles of data are available as having limited regime-conditioning reliability
