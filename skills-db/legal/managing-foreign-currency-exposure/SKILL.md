# Managing Foreign Currency Exposure

Structures FX hedging strategies for international portfolios with natural hedge identification, instrument selection, and cost analysis.

## When To Use

- Designing or reviewing a hedge program for a portfolio with multi-currency cash flows
- Evaluating whether existing natural hedges offset exposure before layering on derivatives
- Selecting FX instruments (forwards, options, cross-currency swaps) for a specific exposure profile
- Analyzing the cost-benefit tradeoff of hedging translation, transaction, or economic exposure
- Preparing an FX risk report for investment committee or cross-border transaction stakeholders
- Assessing emerging-market currency risk where NDF markets or capital controls apply

## Inputs To Gather

- **Currency exposure map**: List of currencies, notional amounts, direction (receivable/payable), and tenor for each position or cash flow stream
- **Portfolio structure**: Entity-level breakdown showing functional currencies, intercompany flows, and consolidation currency
- **Natural hedge inventory**: Existing offsets — revenue/cost matches in the same currency, intercompany netting arrangements, asset/liability currency alignment
- **Market data**: Spot rates, forward points, implied volatilities, basis swap spreads for each currency pair
- **Risk tolerance parameters**: Maximum acceptable unhedged exposure, VaR or CVaR limits, hedge ratio targets, board-approved policy constraints
- **Cost budget**: Acceptable hedge cost as a percentage of notional or basis points of portfolio return
- **Regulatory/tax context**: Capital controls, withholding taxes on derivative settlements, hedge-accounting election status (ASC 815 / IFRS 9 / local GAAP) [VERIFY]

## Workflow

1. **Map gross exposure**
   - Aggregate all foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses by currency and time bucket (e.g., monthly out to 24 months)
   - Classify each exposure as transaction (contractual cash flow), translation (balance-sheet restatement), or economic (competitive/strategic)

2. **Identify natural hedges**
   - Match inflows against outflows in the same currency and tenor band
   - Quantify intercompany netting potential and any reinvoicing-center benefits
   - Calculate residual net exposure per currency after natural offsets

3. **Set hedge ratios and policy alignment**
   - Compare residual exposure to risk-tolerance thresholds and board policy minimums [VERIFY against current FX hedging policy]
   - Determine target hedge ratios per currency (e.g., 75-100% for G10, 50-75% for EM liquid, case-by-case for restricted currencies)
   - Decide the hedge horizon — rolling monthly, quarterly layering, or tenor-matched

4. **Select instruments**
   - **Forwards/NDFs**: Lowest cost for high-certainty cash flows; use NDFs where physical delivery is restricted (e.g., BRL, INR, CNY) [VERIFY NDF market availability for specific currencies]
   - **Options (vanillas and structures)**: Use for uncertain cash flows or when the cost of carry on forwards is prohibitive; evaluate collar, risk-reversal, or participating-forward structures to reduce premium
   - **Cross-currency swaps**: Appropriate for long-dated balance-sheet hedges or debt issuance in foreign currency
   - **Money-market hedges**: Borrowing/lending in foreign currency as an alternative when derivative markets are thin

5. **Analyze cost and carry**
   - Calculate all-in hedge cost: forward points (interest-rate differential), option premium, bid-ask spread, and credit-support costs (CSA/margin)
   - Model hedge effectiveness under IAS 39/IFRS 9 or ASC 815 if hedge accounting is desired [VERIFY applicable accounting standard]
   - Stress-test hedge P&L under ±1 and ±2 standard-deviation FX moves and historical crisis scenarios

6. **Document the hedge program**
   - Prepare a hedge recommendation memo with exposure summary, instrument selection rationale, expected cost, and residual risk
   - Include mark-to-market monitoring triggers and roll/rebalance schedule
   - Define escalation thresholds (e.g., unhedged exposure exceeds X% of NAV, hedge cost exceeds Y bps)

7. **Monitor and report**
   - Track realized vs. expected hedge performance each reporting period
   - Flag basis risk, counterparty concentration, and any material change in exposure (new deal, divestiture, dividend repatriation)
   - Update the exposure map at least monthly; recalibrate hedge ratios quarterly or after material portfolio events

## Output

The deliverable is an **FX Hedge Program Report** containing:

- **Exposure summary table**: Currency, gross exposure, natural offsets, net exposure, hedge ratio, and residual unhedged amount
- **Instrument matrix**: Selected instrument per currency/tenor bucket with notional, strike/rate, maturity, and counterparty
- **Cost analysis**: Annualized hedge cost in basis points of portfolio value, broken out by instrument type
- **Scenario analysis**: P&L impact of hedged vs. unhedged portfolio under base, adverse, and stress FX scenarios
- **Policy compliance statement**: Confirmation that hedge ratios and instruments conform to the approved FX risk policy [VERIFY]
- **Action items**: Trades to execute, documentation to complete (ISDA/CSA confirmations), and next rebalance date

## Quality Checks

- Verify that the exposure map ties to the general ledger or portfolio accounting system — no orphaned positions
- Confirm forward points and option premiums are sourced from live or same-day indicative quotes, not stale data
- Ensure hedge ratios fall within board-approved policy bands; flag and justify any exceptions
- Validate that restricted-currency exposures use the correct instrument (NDF vs. deliverable) given local capital-control rules [VERIFY]
- Check that hedge-accounting designation memos are drafted if the entity elects formal hedge accounting
- Confirm no single counterparty exceeds concentration limits for derivative notional outstanding
- Review that the roll schedule avoids clustering maturities on a single date, which creates liquidity and execution risk
