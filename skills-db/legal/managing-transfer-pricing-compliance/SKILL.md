# Managing Transfer Pricing Compliance

## When To Use

- Preparing or updating annual transfer pricing documentation (local file, master file, CbCR)
- Selecting or defending a transfer pricing method for new or existing intercompany transactions
- Reviewing intercompany agreements for arm's-length consistency
- Responding to tax authority information requests, audits, or adjustments related to transfer pricing
- Onboarding a new intercompany transaction type (services, IP licensing, financing, goods)
- Coordinating multi-jurisdiction TP documentation across subsidiaries

## Inputs To Gather

- **Entity structure**: Legal org chart showing all related-party entities, jurisdictions, and functional roles (entrepreneur, limited-risk distributor, contract manufacturer, IP owner, etc.)
- **Transaction inventory**: List of intercompany transactions by type, counterparties, currencies, and annual volumes
- **Financial data**: Segmented P&L for each tested party; consolidated group financials for profit-split scenarios
- **Functional analysis inputs**: Descriptions of functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed (FAR analysis) for each entity in the transaction chain
- **Existing TP documentation**: Prior-year local files, master file, CbCR, and any advance pricing agreements (APAs) or rulings in effect
- **Comparable data sources**: Access to or extracts from benchmarking databases (e.g., Bureau van Dijk, S&P Capital IQ) [VERIFY availability and license terms]
- **Intercompany agreements**: Current executed contracts governing each transaction type
- **Regulatory requirements**: Jurisdiction-specific documentation thresholds, filing deadlines, and penalty regimes [VERIFY per jurisdiction]

## Workflow

### 1. Scope and Transaction Mapping

- Catalogue all intercompany transactions; classify each by OECD category (tangible goods, services, intangibles, financial transactions, cost contribution arrangements)
- Confirm which entities are the "tested parties" based on functional complexity
- Identify documentation obligations per jurisdiction — master file, local file, CbCR thresholds, and country-specific forms (e.g., Form 5471/8865 for US, TP-Formulaire for France) [VERIFY local thresholds and forms]

### 2. Functional Analysis (FAR)

- For each material transaction, document functions performed, assets used, and risks borne by each counterparty
- Characterize each entity (e.g., full-fledged manufacturer vs. toll manufacturer; principal vs. limited-risk distributor)
- Identify the key value drivers — where significant people functions and decision-making reside, particularly for intangibles and financial transactions

### 3. Method Selection

- Evaluate the five OECD methods against each transaction type:
  - **CUP** (Comparable Uncontrolled Price) — preferred when reliable internal or external comparables exist
  - **Resale Price / Cost Plus** — common for distributors and service providers with limited risk
  - **TNMM / CPM** (Transactional Net Margin Method / Comparable Profits Method) — most frequently applied; requires benchmarking study
  - **Profit Split** — appropriate for highly integrated operations or unique intangible contributions
- Document the "most appropriate method" rationale, including why alternatives were rejected
- For US reporting, confirm alignment with IRC Section 482 "best method" rule [VERIFY if US entities are in scope]

### 4. Benchmarking and Comparable Analysis

- Define search strategy: SIC/NACE codes, geographic filters, independence criteria, size filters, financial year screens
- Run comparable search; apply quantitative screens (e.g., revenue range, R&D intensity, operating margin stability)
- Calculate interquartile range of the profit level indicator (PLI) — operating margin, Berry ratio, net cost plus, etc.
- Compare tested party's results to the arm's-length range; if outside the range, quantify the adjustment needed
- Document rejection log for excluded comparables with specific reasons

### 5. Intercompany Agreement Review

- Verify each agreement reflects the actual conduct of the parties (substance-over-form)
- Confirm pricing clauses match the selected TP method (e.g., cost-plus markup percentage, royalty rate, interest rate)
- Check that risk allocation in contracts aligns with FAR analysis — entities must have financial capacity and operational capability to bear contractually assigned risks (per OECD 2022 guidance)
- Flag any missing agreements or agreements that haven't been updated to reflect current transaction terms

### 6. Documentation Assembly

- **Master file**: Group overview, intangible ownership, intercompany financial activities, group TP policies
- **Local file**: Tested party detail, transaction-specific FAR, method selection, benchmarking results, financial data
- **CbCR (Country-by-Country Report)**: Revenue, profit, tax paid/accrued, employees, and stated capital by jurisdiction
- Ensure internal consistency across all three tiers — figures in the local file should reconcile to the master file and CbCR

### 7. Risk Monitoring and Deadline Tracking

- Maintain a compliance calendar with filing deadlines per jurisdiction [VERIFY annual deadlines — many shift year to year]
- Track penalty exposure for late or incomplete filings (penalties can be significant — e.g., up to $25,000/year per entity for US Form 5472 failures)
- Flag transactions where results fall outside the interquartile range for year-end pricing adjustments
- Monitor regulatory developments (e.g., OECD Pillar One Amount B simplified pricing, EU TP Directive proposals) [VERIFY current status of evolving rules]

## Output

- **Transfer pricing compliance report** covering: transaction inventory, FAR summaries, method selection rationale, benchmarking results with interquartile ranges, and adjustment recommendations
- **Gap analysis matrix**: Identifies missing or outdated intercompany agreements, documentation shortfalls by jurisdiction, and filing deadline risks
- **Action items list**: Prioritized remediation steps — agreement updates, year-end adjustments, APA opportunities, and documentation completion tasks
- **Compliance calendar**: Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction deadlines for local file, master file, CbCR, and related tax filings

## Quality Checks

- Interquartile range calculations are mathematically verified and PLI selection is consistent across tested parties
- FAR analysis matches the entity characterizations used in method selection — no contradictions between functional profile and chosen method
- All comparable rejection reasons are documented; search criteria are reproducible
- Intercompany agreements align with actual pricing and conduct — no contract-vs.-conduct mismatches
- Master file, local file, and CbCR figures are internally consistent and reconcile to audited financials
- Jurisdiction-specific documentation requirements are addressed — not just OECD minimum standards [VERIFY completeness for each in-scope country]
- All assumptions, data limitations, and jurisdiction-dependent conclusions are flagged with [VERIFY]
