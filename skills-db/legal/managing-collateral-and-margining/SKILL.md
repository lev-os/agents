# Managing Collateral And Margining

Analyzes Credit Support Annex (CSA) terms, calculates initial and variation margin requirements, and identifies collateral optimization opportunities across OTC derivatives portfolios.

## When To Use

- Reviewing or negotiating CSA/Credit Support Deed terms for new or amended ISDA relationships
- Calculating initial margin (IM) under UMR/ISDA SIMM or a scheduling approach
- Computing variation margin (VM) calls and resolving margin disputes
- Optimizing collateral posting across multiple CSAs to minimize funding cost
- Assessing the impact of eligible collateral haircuts on portfolio economics
- Preparing for regulatory margin audits or compliance reviews under UMR phases [VERIFY phase applicability based on AANA thresholds and jurisdiction]

## Inputs To Gather

- **CSA/CSD terms**: Thresholds, Minimum Transfer Amounts (MTA), rounding conventions, Independent Amounts, eligible collateral schedules, haircut tables, currency of settlement
- **Portfolio data**: Trade-level MTM valuations, netting set definitions, product types (rates, credit, equity, FX, commodities)
- **Market data**: Discount curves, FX rates, credit spreads for haircut recalibration
- **Regulatory context**: Jurisdiction of each counterparty, UMR phase-in status, clearing mandate applicability [VERIFY local margin rules — EMIR RTS, CFTC, OSFI, APRA, MAS, JFSA each have variations]
- **Operational parameters**: Settlement cut-off times, custodian/tri-party agent details, substitution rights, rehypothecation permissions

## Workflow

1. **Parse CSA Terms**
   - Extract threshold, MTA, rounding, and Independent Amount for each direction (Party A / Party B)
   - Map eligible collateral schedule: asset types, issuer constraints, concentration limits, and applicable haircuts
   - Flag asymmetric terms, one-way posting obligations, or non-standard provisions

2. **Calculate Variation Margin**
   - Net MTM across all trades in the netting set using agreed valuation methodology
   - Apply threshold and MTA to derive the delivery/return amount
   - Determine call direction and round per CSA rounding convention
   - For disputed amounts, isolate trade-level MTM differences and document the dispute resolution path

3. **Calculate Initial Margin**
   - **ISDA SIMM**: Compute sensitivities (delta, vega, curvature) per risk class, apply risk weights and correlations per ISDA SIMM methodology version [VERIFY current SIMM version — recalibrated annually in December]
   - **Schedule-based**: Apply notional-based percentages by product type per regulatory schedule
   - **Grid/Internal model**: Run VaR or ES at 99% confidence, 10-day MPOR, with netting and diversification benefits as permitted
   - Compare bilateral IM amounts; the higher of the two parties' calculations typically governs [VERIFY governing calculation election in CSA]

4. **Optimize Collateral Posting**
   - Rank eligible assets by funding cost (opportunity cost of posting vs. retained yield)
   - Factor in haircuts — a lower-haircut asset may be cheaper even if its yield is slightly higher
   - Check concentration limits, wrong-way risk constraints, and issuer caps before allocating
   - Model substitution scenarios: swapping government bonds for cash or vice versa to free up HQLA buffers
   - Consider cross-CSA netting if tri-party or collateral management platform supports it

5. **Reconcile and Settle**
   - Generate margin call notices with settlement instructions and value date
   - Reconcile portfolio and margin amounts with the counterparty (daily for VM, as required for IM)
   - Track pending settlements, fails, and aged items; escalate fails beyond T+1

## Output

- **Margin Summary Report**: Net exposure per netting set, VM call amount and direction, IM requirement by method, collateral posted/received breakdown by asset type
- **CSA Terms Matrix**: Side-by-side comparison of key terms across counterparties (thresholds, MTAs, eligible collateral, haircuts, rehypothecation rights)
- **Collateral Optimization Analysis**: Current vs. recommended posting allocation, estimated funding cost savings, concentration utilization heatmap
- **Dispute Log** (if applicable): Trade-level MTM differences, proposed resolution, escalation status
- **Regulatory Compliance Checklist**: UMR phase compliance, segregation requirements, custodian documentation status [VERIFY against applicable regulatory regime]

## Quality Checks

- Confirm netting set definitions match ISDA Master Agreement netting opinions for each jurisdiction [VERIFY enforceability opinions are current]
- Validate that haircuts applied match the CSA schedule — do not default to regulatory standard haircuts unless CSA references them
- Cross-check IM calculations against counterparty statements; differences above a defined tolerance (e.g., 10%) require investigation
- Ensure MTA and threshold are applied in the correct direction and currency; misapplication is a common source of margin call errors
- Verify that collateral posted meets eligibility criteria as of the valuation date (credit rating downgrades can disqualify previously eligible securities)
- Confirm settlement instructions reference the correct custodian/tri-party account and that SSIs are up to date
