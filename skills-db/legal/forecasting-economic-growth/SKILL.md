# Forecasting Economic Growth

Structures GDP growth forecasting with component analysis, nowcasting techniques, and revision tracking.

## When To Use

- Building quarterly or annual GDP growth projections for a specific economy
- Decomposing GDP into expenditure components (C + I + G + NX) to identify growth drivers
- Producing nowcasts using high-frequency indicators ahead of official releases
- Assessing the impact of policy changes (fiscal stimulus, rate decisions, trade policy) on growth trajectories
- Tracking and interpreting GDP revisions across advance, second, and third estimates
- Constructing scenario-based growth outlooks for investment committees or policy briefings

## Inputs To Gather

- **Target economy and horizon**: Country/region, forecast start quarter, and projection length (e.g., US, Q3 2026 through Q4 2027)
- **National accounts data**: Latest GDP release (level and growth rates, seasonally adjusted annualized rate vs. quarter-on-quarter), at least 8 quarters of history
- **Expenditure components**: Personal consumption, gross private domestic investment (fixed + inventories), government spending, exports, imports — with sub-component detail where available
- **High-frequency indicators**: PMI/ISM surveys, industrial production, retail sales, payrolls, initial claims, consumer confidence, housing starts, vehicle sales
- **Financial conditions**: Policy rate path (actual + market-implied), yield curve shape, credit spreads, equity market levels, USD trade-weighted index
- **Fiscal and trade policy inputs**: Enacted or proposed legislation, tariff schedules, government budget outlays [VERIFY against latest legislative status]
- **Consensus benchmarks**: Bloomberg/Reuters survey medians, IMF WEO, OECD Economic Outlook, Fed SEP, Blue Chip consensus
- **Special factors**: Weather disruptions, strikes, inventory cycles, one-off statistical reclassifications

## Workflow

1. **Establish the base picture**
   - Record latest official GDP print: headline growth rate, component contributions, and statistical discrepancy
   - Note the release vintage (advance/second/third) and the typical revision pattern for that statistical agency [VERIFY revision norms for non-US economies]
   - Chart the recent trajectory — identify whether growth is accelerating, decelerating, or at trend

2. **Decompose by expenditure component**
   - For each component (consumption, investment, government, net exports), assess:
     - Recent trend and momentum (3-quarter moving average of contributions)
     - Leading indicators specific to that component (e.g., real disposable income and saving rate for consumption; durable goods orders and capacity utilization for capex)
     - Known structural shifts (fiscal cliff, capex super-cycle, inventory restocking)
   - Assign a point estimate and reasonable range for each component's contribution to headline growth

3. **Apply nowcasting for the current/next quarter**
   - Map high-frequency data releases to GDP components using bridge equations or factor models
   - Weight indicators by publication timeliness and historical tracking accuracy
   - Update the nowcast as each new data point arrives; log the incremental revision and its source
   - Cross-check against GDPNow-style tracker models where available [VERIFY availability for non-US economies]

4. **Build the medium-term projection**
   - Extend component forecasts beyond the nowcast quarter using:
     - Estimated potential growth rate (trend labor force growth + productivity trend)
     - Output gap trajectory — is the economy above/below potential, and how fast is it closing?
     - Policy impulse: compute fiscal impulse (change in cyclically adjusted primary balance) and monetary stance (real policy rate vs. neutral rate estimate) [VERIFY neutral rate assumptions]
   - Layer in scenario analysis:
     - **Base case**: Most probable policy and macro path
     - **Upside**: Stronger consumption momentum, faster capex recovery, or positive trade shock
     - **Downside**: Financial conditions tightening, trade disruption, fiscal drag
   - Assign subjective probabilities to each scenario

5. **Validate and stress-test**
   - Compare headline forecast to consensus — identify and explain any meaningful divergence
   - Check internal consistency: does the implied saving rate, import elasticity, or inventory-to-sales ratio remain plausible?
   - Run sensitivity analysis on the two or three assumptions with the highest forecast leverage
   - Flag any component where the projection falls outside the historical interquartile range

6. **Track revisions and update cycle**
   - Maintain a revision log: date, data release, prior forecast, revised forecast, and magnitude of change
   - After each official GDP release, compute forecast error and decompose by component contribution
   - Identify systematic bias (persistent over/under-estimation of a component) and adjust methodology

## Output

The forecast report should contain:

- **Executive summary**: Headline GDP growth forecast (point estimate with confidence interval) for each quarter in the projection horizon, plus annual average
- **Component contribution table**: Percentage-point contributions from consumption, investment, government, and net exports — base, upside, and downside scenarios
- **Nowcast detail**: Current-quarter tracking estimate with data-release waterfall showing incremental updates
- **Scenario matrix**: Growth path under each scenario with assigned probabilities and key trigger events
- **Risk register**: Top 3–5 risks to the forecast, directional impact, and the indicator that would signal materialization
- **Revision history**: Log of prior forecasts, actuals, and error decomposition
- **Methodology note**: Model type (structural, reduced-form, judgmental overlay), data sources, seasonal adjustment conventions, and vintage dates

## Quality Checks

- Component contributions sum to headline growth (within rounding tolerance)
- Nowcast uses only data available as of the stated knowledge cutoff — no look-ahead bias
- Confidence intervals widen appropriately as the forecast horizon extends
- Scenarios are internally consistent (e.g., a recession scenario should show rising unemployment and falling imports, not just lower consumption)
- All external data sources are cited with publication date and vintage
- Statistical agency release calendars are referenced so the next update trigger is clear [VERIFY release schedule for the target economy]
- Forecast is compared to at least two independent consensus sources
- Any assumption about policy rates, fiscal policy, or exchange rates is explicitly stated and tagged [VERIFY] where jurisdiction-dependent
