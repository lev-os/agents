# Analyzing Market Regime Indicators

Monitors market regime signals with volatility clustering, correlation dynamics, and liquidity condition assessment.

## When To Use

- Detecting shifts between risk-on, risk-off, and transitional market environments
- Evaluating whether current volatility, correlation, and liquidity conditions support or threaten an active strategy
- Adjusting position sizing, hedge ratios, or execution tactics based on regime state
- Providing context for anomalous P&L moves or unexpected factor exposures
- Pre-trade analysis before deploying new systematic or discretionary strategies

## Inputs To Gather

- **Volatility data**: Realized vol (close-to-close, intraday high-low), implied vol surfaces (VIX, VVIX, asset-class-specific vol indices), term structure shape (contango/backwardation)
- **Correlation data**: Rolling pairwise correlations across major asset classes, intra-sector correlation, cross-asset dispersion metrics
- **Liquidity metrics**: Bid-ask spreads, market depth (top-of-book and aggregate), volume profiles, ETF creation/redemption flow, repo rates
- **Macro context**: Recent central bank communications, key economic releases, fiscal policy changes [VERIFY: data recency and source reliability]
- **Positioning data**: CFTC COT reports, prime brokerage net exposure estimates, options open interest and skew shifts
- **Time horizon**: Intraday, short-term (1–5 days), medium-term (1–3 months), or structural

## Workflow

1. **Classify current volatility regime**
   - Compute realized vol at multiple lookback windows (5d, 21d, 63d) and compare to 1y and 3y percentile ranks
   - Assess vol term structure: contango suggests stable regime; backwardation or inversion signals stress or event risk
   - Check for volatility clustering: are recent daily moves serially correlated? Use GARCH-style diagnostics or rolling kurtosis
   - Flag regime: **Low-vol compressed**, **Normal**, **Elevated/trending**, or **Crisis/spike**

2. **Evaluate correlation dynamics**
   - Compute rolling cross-asset correlations (equities/bonds, equities/credit, commodities/FX) at 21d and 63d windows
   - Identify correlation breakdowns or convergences vs. trailing 1y norms
   - Measure intra-asset-class dispersion (e.g., single-stock vs. index vol ratio) — low dispersion = high correlation regime
   - Flag: **Diversification intact**, **Correlation rising**, or **Correlation breakdown (crisis-mode)**

3. **Assess liquidity conditions**
   - Compare current bid-ask spreads and depth to 30d and 90d medians across target instruments
   - Check for liquidity withdrawal signals: declining volume, widening spreads at unchanged vol, reduced dark pool participation
   - Review funding markets: overnight repo rates, cross-currency basis, CP/CD spreads [VERIFY: current funding rate benchmarks per jurisdiction]
   - Flag: **Ample**, **Tightening**, or **Stressed**

4. **Synthesize regime classification**
   - Combine volatility, correlation, and liquidity flags into an overall regime label:
     - **Risk-on**: Low/normal vol + diversification intact + ample liquidity
     - **Transitional**: Mixed signals across dimensions — one or two flags shifting
     - **Risk-off**: Elevated vol + rising correlations + tightening/stressed liquidity
     - **Crisis**: Vol spike + correlation breakdown + stressed liquidity
   - Note any divergences between dimensions (e.g., low vol but deteriorating liquidity) as early warning signals

5. **Map regime to actionable implications**
   - **Position sizing**: Reduce gross exposure as regime shifts from risk-on toward risk-off; apply vol-targeting or risk-parity adjustments
   - **Hedging**: In transitional regimes, increase tail hedges; in crisis, evaluate whether hedges are still liquid and effective
   - **Execution**: In stressed liquidity, shift to passive/VWAP execution; avoid large block trades; consider alternative venues
   - **Strategy selection**: Mean-reversion strategies favor low-vol regimes; momentum/trend strategies favor elevated-vol trending regimes

## Output

- **Regime Summary Table**: Current classification for each dimension (volatility, correlation, liquidity) with percentile ranks and flag labels
- **Overall Regime Label** with confidence level (high/medium/low) and key supporting data points
- **Transition Signals**: Leading indicators suggesting the current regime may be shifting, with estimated timeline
- **Strategy Implications**: Concrete adjustments to sizing, hedging, and execution for the identified regime
- **Watch List**: Specific data points or thresholds that, if breached, would trigger a regime reclassification

## Quality Checks

- Confirm all vol and correlation calculations use consistent return conventions (log vs. arithmetic) and time zones
- Verify lookback windows are appropriate for the stated time horizon — do not use 63d rolling stats for intraday regime calls
- Cross-check regime classification against recent market narrative — if classification contradicts obvious market behavior, re-examine inputs
- Ensure liquidity assessment covers the specific instruments being traded, not just broad index proxies
- Flag any data gaps, stale quotes, or holiday-affected windows that may distort rolling calculations
- Mark jurisdiction-dependent metrics (repo rates, regulatory reporting thresholds) with [VERIFY]
