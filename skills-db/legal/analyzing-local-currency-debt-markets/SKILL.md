# Analyzing Local Currency Debt Markets

## When To Use

- Evaluating local currency sovereign or corporate bond issuances for portfolio inclusion or mandate sizing
- Comparing real yield differentials across emerging market local currency curves
- Assessing FX-hedged and unhedged carry opportunities in EM debt
- Screening local currency markets for entry/exit timing based on macro and flow dynamics
- Conducting relative value analysis between hard currency (USD/EUR) and local currency bonds from the same sovereign or corporate issuer

## Inputs To Gather

- **Sovereign yield curves**: Local currency government bond yields across tenors (3M, 1Y, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y where available)
- **Inflation data**: Headline and core CPI, central bank inflation target, inflation expectations (survey-based or breakeven-derived)
- **Central bank policy**: Current policy rate, forward guidance, recent rate decisions, reserve requirement changes
- **FX data**: Spot rate, NDF/forward curve, implied yield differential, 3M and 12M realized and implied volatility
- **Credit context**: Sovereign credit rating (Moody's/S&P/Fitch), CDS spreads, external debt ratios, fiscal balance trajectory
- **Flow and positioning data**: Foreign ownership share of local debt, recent flow trends (IIF, EPFR, or central bank data), index inclusion status (GBI-EM, EMLC)
- **Corporate bond specifics** (if applicable): Issuer financials, issue size, liquidity metrics, sector, and local market benchmarks

## Workflow

1. **Define scope and market selection**
   - Identify target country/countries and whether analysis covers sovereign, corporate, or both
   - Confirm currency (some markets have multiple instruments — e.g., inflation-linked vs. nominal)
   - Set analysis horizon (tactical 1–3 month vs. strategic 6–12 month)

2. **Build the yield and real rate picture**
   - Plot the local currency nominal yield curve and compare to 6M/12M prior
   - Calculate real yields: nominal yield minus trailing 12M CPI and minus forward inflation expectations
   - Compare real yields to peers in the same region or rating cohort
   - Identify curve shape signals: steepening (rate cuts expected), flattening (tightening or compression), inversion (stress)

3. **Assess inflation dynamics and central bank trajectory**
   - Evaluate whether inflation is trending toward or away from target
   - Assess central bank credibility: track record of hitting targets, independence from fiscal authority [VERIFY: central bank mandate and independence vary by jurisdiction]
   - Map likely policy path: rate cuts, holds, or hikes over the analysis horizon
   - Flag supply-side inflation risks (food, energy, administered prices) distinct from demand-pull

4. **Analyze FX carry and hedging costs**
   - Calculate unhedged carry: local yield minus funding currency yield (e.g., UST or SOFR)
   - Calculate hedged carry using NDF-implied yields or cross-currency basis
   - Assess whether positive carry compensates for FX volatility — compare carry-to-vol ratio
   - Identify FX regime risks: managed float, crawling peg, capital controls, intervention history [VERIFY: capital control and repatriation rules for each market]

5. **Evaluate credit and liquidity risk**
   - Review sovereign fiscal trajectory: primary balance, debt/GDP, rollover profile
   - For corporates, assess credit spread relative to sovereign (spread-over-sovereign) and sector comps
   - Check market liquidity: average daily trading volume, bid-ask spreads, settlement conventions [VERIFY: settlement cycle and custody arrangements for foreign investors]
   - Note index eligibility and weight — index-driven flows can dominate smaller markets

6. **Synthesize relative value and positioning**
   - Rank markets on a composite basis: real yield, carry attractiveness, credit quality, liquidity, FX risk
   - Compare local currency vs. hard currency spreads from the same issuer (basis differential)
   - Factor in foreign positioning: crowded longs amplify drawdown risk during risk-off episodes
   - Identify catalysts: upcoming elections, IMF reviews, rating actions, index rebalances

## Output

Produce a structured analysis report containing:

- **Market overview table**: Country, currency, policy rate, 10Y yield, CPI, real yield, sovereign rating, foreign ownership %
- **Real yield comparison**: Chart or table showing real yields vs. regional/rating peers
- **Carry analysis**: Unhedged and hedged carry for each market, carry-to-vol ratio
- **FX risk assessment**: Volatility regime, intervention risk, capital account openness
- **Relative value scorecard**: Composite ranking across yield, credit, liquidity, and FX dimensions
- **Recommendation summary**: Overweight / neutral / underweight positioning with key risks and catalysts
- **Risk factors**: Itemized downside scenarios (inflation surprise, FX depreciation, political risk, liquidity withdrawal)

## Quality Checks

- Real yield calculations use consistent inflation measures (trailing vs. forward) — state which is used
- FX carry figures reconcile with observable NDF or forward rates, not theoretical interest rate parity
- Foreign ownership and flow data are dated — flag if older than one quarter
- Sovereign ratings and outlook are current; note any recent rating watch or review [VERIFY: check all three major agencies for latest action]
- Liquidity assessments reflect actual market conditions, not just issue size — small markets with large outstanding can still be illiquid
- Recommendations distinguish between funded (cash bond) and unfunded (CDS/NDF) expression of views
- All jurisdiction-specific regulatory constraints on foreign participation are flagged with [VERIFY]
