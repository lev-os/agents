# Analyzing Infrastructure Asset Valuations

## When To Use

- Valuing a brownfield infrastructure asset for acquisition, disposition, or refinancing
- Analyzing a regulated utility's rate base and allowed return for investment screening
- Benchmarking a proposed PPP/concession price against comparable transactions
- Supporting bid pricing for infrastructure fund portfolio assets (toll roads, airports, water/wastewater, energy transmission, district energy)
- Assessing fair market value for GP/LP reporting, NAV calculations, or impairment testing

## Inputs To Gather

- **Asset profile**: asset type (regulated utility, contracted, merchant/hybrid), jurisdiction, remaining concession or useful life, capacity/throughput metrics
- **Financial data**: historical and projected revenue, EBITDA, capex (maintenance vs. growth), working capital, debt structure and covenants
- **Regulatory framework**: rate-setting mechanism (cost-of-service, incentive/performance-based, hybrid), rate case cycle, allowed ROE/WACC, regulatory asset base (RAB) roll-forward methodology [VERIFY against jurisdiction-specific tariff orders]
- **Contractual terms**: offtake/PPA/availability payment structure, escalation mechanisms (CPI-linked, fixed, regulatory reset), termination and handback provisions
- **Comparable transactions**: recent M&A comps (EV/EBITDA, EV/RAB, price-per-MW, price-per-lane-km), premium/discount drivers
- **Macro assumptions**: inflation curve, risk-free rate, country risk premium, sector beta, illiquidity discount (if private)

## Workflow

1. **Classify the asset and select valuation approaches**
   - Determine primary methodology based on asset type:
     - **Regulated assets** → RAB-based valuation (RAB × allowed return build-up) cross-checked with DCF
     - **Contracted assets** (PPP, availability-based) → project-finance DCF with contracted cash flows
     - **Merchant/hybrid assets** → DCF with probability-weighted revenue scenarios plus comparable transactions
   - Identify whether a sum-of-the-parts approach is needed for diversified portfolios

2. **Build the DCF model**
   - Forecast free cash flows to firm (FCFF) over the concession/asset life or a defined projection period
   - Apply appropriate discount rate: nominal vs. real WACC, pre-tax vs. post-tax, reflecting regulatory allowed return where applicable [VERIFY WACC components against current market benchmarks]
   - Model terminal value only where asset life extends beyond projection horizon; for finite-life concessions, use explicit cash flows to handback
   - Stress-test key drivers: traffic/volume ramp, tariff escalation, capex overruns, refinancing risk

3. **Perform RAB-based valuation (regulated assets)**
   - Roll forward the regulated asset base: opening RAB + capex additions − regulatory depreciation ± inflation indexation [VERIFY RAB methodology per regulator]
   - Apply allowed return (equity + debt components) to derive regulated revenue requirement
   - Assess RAB multiples (EV/RAB) and compare to observable trading and transaction multiples for the sector/jurisdiction
   - Identify regulatory risk factors: periodic review resets, efficiency targets (X-factor), stranded asset risk

4. **Run comparable transaction analysis**
   - Select comps by sub-sector, geography, contract type, and vintage
   - Normalize multiples for leverage differences, remaining life, growth capex embedded in price, and regulatory regime quality
   - Apply EV/EBITDA, EV/RAB, or sector-specific unit metrics (e.g., $/MW for renewables, $/million-gallons-per-day for water)
   - Adjust for control premium, portfolio premium/discount, and liquidity

5. **Triangulate and reconcile**
   - Present a valuation range from each methodology in a summary table
   - Identify and explain key sources of divergence across methods
   - State the preferred methodology with rationale tied to asset characteristics
   - Flag sensitivity of valuation to top-3 assumptions (discount rate, volume/growth, regulatory reset)

## Output

- **Valuation summary table**: methodology, low/base/high range, implied multiples
- **DCF detail**: projection period cash flows, discount rate build-up, terminal/handback value, sensitivity tornado chart
- **RAB analysis** (if applicable): RAB roll-forward schedule, allowed return calculation, EV/RAB implied vs. comps
- **Comparable transactions table**: deal name, date, sub-sector, geography, EV, multiples, adjustments applied
- **Key risk factors**: regulatory, volume, contractual, political/country, refinancing
- **Recommendation / fair value conclusion**: point estimate or range with stated confidence level

## Quality Checks

- Discount rate components sourced from current market data and consistent with asset risk profile (do not apply corporate WACC to project-level cash flows)
- RAB roll-forward ties to most recent regulatory determination or tariff filing [VERIFY]
- Comparable transactions are filtered for relevance — comps older than 5 years or from materially different regulatory regimes flagged with caveat
- Cash flow projections internally consistent (revenue growth aligns with volume and tariff assumptions; capex aligns with asset condition / regulatory commitments)
- Inflation assumptions explicit and consistent across nominal/real frameworks — no mixing of nominal cash flows with real discount rates
- All jurisdiction-specific regulatory parameters (allowed ROE, gearing, depreciation method, incentive mechanisms) marked [VERIFY] where sourced from secondary data
- Sensitivity analysis covers at minimum: ±100 bps on discount rate, ±10–20% on volume/revenue, and capex overrun scenario
