# Managing Cybersecurity Compliance

Evaluates cybersecurity programs against SEC, FINRA, and state regulatory requirements for broker-dealers, investment advisers, and other regulated financial entities.

## When To Use

- Assessing a firm's cybersecurity posture against SEC Regulation S-P, Regulation S-ID, or proposed/adopted cyber disclosure rules
- Evaluating FINRA compliance with Rules 3110 (supervision), 4370 (BCP), and cybersecurity-related notices (e.g., Regulatory Notice 21-18)
- Preparing for or responding to SEC or FINRA cybersecurity examination sweeps
- Implementing or benchmarking against NIST Cybersecurity Framework as recommended by SEC/FINRA guidance
- Reviewing state-level cybersecurity requirements (e.g., NY DFS 23 NYCRR 500, CCPA/CPRA data security obligations) [VERIFY state applicability based on firm registration and customer base]
- Responding to a cyber incident that triggers regulatory notification obligations

## Inputs To Gather

- **Firm profile**: Registration type (BD, IA, dual), AUM/customer account volume, number of offices and employees
- **Existing policies and procedures**: Written information security policy (WISP), incident response plan, BCP, vendor management policy, data governance/classification policy
- **Prior examination results**: SEC exam deficiency letters, FINRA findings, internal audit reports related to cybersecurity
- **Technical environment summary**: Network architecture overview, cloud service providers, third-party vendors with access to customer data or systems
- **Current framework alignment**: Whether the firm has mapped controls to NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, or another framework
- **Incident history**: Prior breaches, near-misses, SARs filed related to cyber events, any Reg S-P breach notifications issued
- **Regulatory correspondence**: Any recent SEC or FINRA risk alerts, sweep letters, or information requests related to cybersecurity

## Workflow

1. **Map regulatory obligations**
   - Identify all applicable SEC rules: Reg S-P (safeguards rule), Reg S-ID (identity theft red flags), proposed cyber incident reporting rules [VERIFY current rule status—check if SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules have been finalized or amended]
   - Identify FINRA obligations: supervisory procedures for cyber risk, BCP requirements addressing cyber disruption, customer notification duties
   - Identify state requirements: NY DFS 500 (if applicable), state breach notification laws for each jurisdiction where customers reside [VERIFY state-by-state notification timelines and content requirements]

2. **Assess current controls against requirements**
   - Evaluate governance structure: designated CISO or equivalent, board/senior management reporting cadence, cybersecurity committee or function
   - Review access controls: least-privilege implementation, MFA deployment, privileged access management
   - Assess data protection: encryption at rest and in transit, data loss prevention controls, customer PII inventory and classification
   - Review vendor/third-party risk management: due diligence process, contractual security requirements, ongoing monitoring
   - Evaluate incident response readiness: documented IR plan, defined roles and escalation paths, tabletop exercise history, regulatory notification procedures and timelines
   - Check training program: content coverage (phishing, social engineering, insider threat), frequency, tracking and completion records

3. **Perform gap analysis**
   - Map each regulatory requirement to specific existing controls or identify gaps
   - Categorize gaps by severity: critical (direct regulatory exposure), high (material weakness), medium (best-practice shortfall), low (enhancement opportunity)
   - Cross-reference against recent SEC/FINRA examination priorities and risk alerts to flag areas of heightened regulatory focus

4. **Develop remediation roadmap**
   - Prioritize gaps by regulatory risk, likelihood of examination scrutiny, and implementation complexity
   - Assign ownership and target completion dates for each remediation item
   - Identify quick wins (policy updates, training refreshers) vs. longer-term projects (technology deployments, vendor renegotiations)
   - Establish interim compensating controls for critical gaps that require extended remediation timelines

5. **Document and report**
   - Produce a compliance assessment report suitable for senior management or board presentation
   - Include executive summary, methodology, findings by regulatory domain, risk ratings, and remediation plan
   - Attach supporting evidence matrix mapping controls to specific regulatory citations

## Output

The deliverable is a **Cybersecurity Compliance Assessment Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Overall compliance posture rating, top risks, and priority actions
- **Regulatory obligation matrix**: Each applicable rule/requirement mapped to current control status (compliant, partially compliant, non-compliant, not applicable)
- **Detailed findings**: Organized by regulatory source (SEC, FINRA, state), each finding including the requirement citation, current state, gap description, risk rating, and recommended remediation
- **Remediation roadmap**: Prioritized action items with owners, timelines, resource estimates, and interim measures
- **Appendices**: Control evidence inventory, examination history summary, framework crosswalk (e.g., NIST CSF mapping)

## Quality Checks

- Every finding cites a specific regulatory rule, guidance document, or examination priority reference
- Gap severity ratings are consistently applied using the defined categorization criteria
- Remediation recommendations are actionable (specific steps, not vague directives like "improve cybersecurity")
- State-specific requirements are flagged with [VERIFY] where jurisdiction-dependent variations exist
- Report distinguishes between binding regulatory requirements and voluntary best-practice recommendations
- Incident notification timelines are accurate for each applicable regulator and state [VERIFY current timelines—SEC, FINRA, and state requirements change frequently]
- No assumptions are made about the firm's technical environment without input data; missing information is noted as a gap in the assessment
