# Analyzing Cross Asset Correlation Dynamics

## When To Use

- Evaluating portfolio diversification effectiveness across equities, fixed income, commodities, FX, and alternatives
- Detecting correlation regime shifts (e.g., crisis convergence where historically uncorrelated assets move together)
- Assessing hedging reliability before or during stress events
- Reviewing cross-asset pair/basket correlations for trading desk risk limits
- Constructing or rebalancing multi-asset portfolios where correlation assumptions drive allocation

## Inputs To Gather

- **Asset universe**: Specific tickers, indices, or asset class proxies (e.g., SPX, UST 10Y, Gold, DXY, VIX, HY credit spreads)
- **Return series**: Daily, weekly, or monthly returns — confirm frequency and total observation window
- **Lookback periods**: Rolling window lengths (e.g., 30-day, 90-day, 1-year) and any comparison periods
- **Regime definitions**: Criteria for market regimes — volatility thresholds (e.g., VIX > 25 = stress), trend filters, or drawdown-based classifications
- **Benchmark correlation matrix**: Any prior or target correlation assumptions the portfolio was built on
- **Purpose context**: Is this for risk monitoring, trade construction, allocation rebalance, or post-mortem analysis?

## Workflow

1. **Compute baseline correlation matrix**
   - Calculate pairwise Pearson correlations across the full sample period
   - Supplement with Spearman rank correlations to capture non-linear dependence
   - Flag any pairs with fewer observations than the chosen lookback window

2. **Run rolling correlation analysis**
   - Compute rolling correlations at specified window lengths (e.g., 30d, 90d, 252d)
   - Identify periods where correlations deviate more than 2 standard deviations from their long-run average
   - Note any structural breaks — sustained shifts vs. transient spikes

3. **Segment by market regime**
   - Classify observation periods into regimes (e.g., low-vol/trending, high-vol/crisis, transition)
   - Compute separate correlation matrices for each regime
   - Quantify correlation convergence in stress regimes — measure average pairwise correlation increase vs. calm periods
   - Highlight "correlation breakdown" pairs: assets assumed uncorrelated that converge to >0.6 in stress [VERIFY: threshold depends on portfolio mandate]

4. **Assess diversification effectiveness**
   - Compare realized correlation matrix against the benchmark/assumed matrix used for portfolio construction
   - Calculate diversification ratio: (weighted average vol) / (portfolio vol) — values closer to 1.0 signal diversification failure
   - Identify the top 3-5 pairs contributing most to portfolio variance through high/rising correlation
   - Flag any "illusory diversifiers" — assets that provide diversification in calm markets but converge in drawdowns

5. **Evaluate tail dependence**
   - Examine joint drawdown frequency: how often do assets decline simultaneously beyond a threshold (e.g., both down >1σ on same day)?
   - Compare lower-tail dependence vs. upper-tail — asymmetric co-movement is common (assets correlate more in selloffs)
   - Note implications for hedge effectiveness and tail-risk budgeting

6. **Synthesize findings and trading/risk implications**
   - Summarize which correlation assumptions still hold and which have broken down
   - Recommend specific adjustments: hedge ratio changes, pair trade viability, allocation shifts
   - Flag any correlations trending toward levels that would breach risk limits or mandate constraints

## Output

- **Correlation summary table**: Full-sample and regime-conditional matrices side by side
- **Rolling correlation charts**: Time series for key pairs with regime shading
- **Diversification scorecard**: Realized vs. assumed diversification ratio, with contributing pair breakdown
- **Regime analysis**: Correlation statistics per regime with transition dates
- **Risk alerts**: Pairs approaching or breaching thresholds, with directional trend
- **Actionable recommendations**: Specific hedging, rebalancing, or position-sizing adjustments

## Quality Checks

- Confirm return series are aligned (same timestamps, no stale prices or holiday mismatches)
- Verify correlation calculations exclude periods of zero variance or illiquid/halted instruments
- Cross-check that regime classifications are applied consistently across all pairs
- Ensure rolling windows have sufficient observations (minimum ~30 data points per window)
- Validate that any stated diversification benefit is tested in stress as well as calm conditions
- Mark any data gaps, proxy substitutions, or short-history assets with [VERIFY]
- Do not present correlations from mixed-frequency data without explicit resampling disclosure
