# Managing Pension Fund Obligations

## When To Use

- Analyzing a pension plan's funded status (PBO vs. plan assets) for board or CFO reporting
- Reviewing actuarial valuation reports and challenging key assumptions (discount rate, mortality, salary growth)
- Planning employer contributions to meet minimum funding requirements or optimize cash flow
- Preparing for fiscal year-end pension accounting entries under ASC 715 or IAS 19 [VERIFY]
- Evaluating pension risk transfer options (lump-sum buyouts, annuity purchases, plan freezes)
- Assessing the impact of benefit design changes on long-term obligations

## Inputs To Gather

- **Most recent actuarial valuation report** — including projected benefit obligation (PBO), accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and plan asset fair value
- **Plan document and amendments** — benefit formula, eligibility rules, vesting schedule, and any recent changes
- **Asset allocation and investment policy statement** — current allocation, target allocation, and expected return assumptions
- **Census data summary** — active participants, vested terminations, retirees, and beneficiaries with demographics
- **Discount rate and assumption basis** — source (e.g., FTSE Pension Discount Curve, spot-rate approach), mortality table (e.g., Pri-2012 with MP-2021 improvement scale) [VERIFY]
- **Contribution history** — employer contributions for the last 3-5 years, minimum required contribution schedule
- **ASC 715 / IAS 19 disclosures** — prior-year financial statement pension footnotes for trend analysis [VERIFY]
- **Funding policy or target** — any board-approved funding policy above statutory minimums

## Workflow

1. **Establish funded status baseline**
   - Calculate funded ratio: plan assets / PBO (or solvency basis if applicable)
   - Reconcile beginning-of-year to end-of-year PBO: service cost + interest cost + plan amendments + actuarial losses/gains − benefits paid
   - Reconcile plan assets: beginning balance + actual return + employer contributions − benefits paid − expenses
   - Flag any funded status below 80% as a potential at-risk plan under ERISA [VERIFY]

2. **Evaluate actuarial assumptions**
   - Compare the discount rate to benchmark yield curves; a 25 bps change in discount rate typically moves PBO by 3-5% for a mature plan — quantify sensitivity
   - Assess mortality table vintage and improvement scale; note if the plan uses outdated tables
   - Review salary growth assumption against actual compensation trends for the last 3-5 years
   - Check expected return on assets (EROA) against actual returns and asset allocation; an aggressive EROA reduces reported pension expense but does not change cash contributions
   - Document assumption changes year-over-year and their individual impact on obligation

3. **Determine contribution requirements and strategy**
   - Calculate minimum required contribution under ERISA Section 303 (or applicable local statute) [VERIFY]
   - Identify any shortfall amortization installments and their remaining schedules
   - Model voluntary contribution scenarios: (a) minimum only, (b) target 90% funded, (c) target 100% funded
   - Assess tax deductibility limits (IRC Section 404 cap at 150% of current liability for single-employer plans) [VERIFY]
   - Map contribution schedule against corporate cash flow forecasts and capital allocation priorities

4. **Assess risk and de-risking options**
   - Quantify interest rate sensitivity: impact of +/− 50 bps on PBO and net periodic pension cost
   - Quantify longevity risk: impact of one additional year of life expectancy on obligation
   - Evaluate liability-driven investing (LDI) strategy alignment — compare asset duration to liability duration
   - Analyze pension risk transfer options: annuity buy-in, buy-out, or lump-sum window with cost-benefit estimate
   - Consider plan design changes: soft freeze, hard freeze, or conversion to cash balance plan with projected savings

5. **Prepare management report**
   - Summarize funded status, year-over-year change, and key drivers
   - Present assumption sensitivity analysis in tabular format
   - Outline contribution scenarios with cash flow impact and funded ratio projections over 3-5 years
   - Highlight risks, recommended actions, and decision deadlines (e.g., contribution due date, plan amendment effective date)
   - Include accounting impact: expected net periodic pension cost components (service cost, interest cost, expected return, amortization of losses/prior service cost)

## Output

The deliverable is a **Pension Obligation Management Report** containing:

- **Executive summary** — funded status, key risks, and recommended action in 3-5 sentences
- **Funded status reconciliation** — walk-forward of PBO and plan assets with variance explanations
- **Assumption review table** — each assumption with current value, prior-year value, benchmark, and sensitivity impact
- **Contribution scenario matrix** — minimum, moderate, and full-funding scenarios with annual cash outflows and projected funded ratios
- **Risk dashboard** — interest rate, longevity, and investment return risk with quantified exposure
- **Recommended actions** — prioritized list with timeline and responsible parties

## Quality Checks

- Verify PBO and asset reconciliations tie to the actuarial valuation report within acceptable rounding tolerance
- Confirm discount rate source and methodology are consistent with the entity's accounting policy [VERIFY]
- Ensure contribution calculations reference the correct plan year and applicable funding rules by jurisdiction [VERIFY]
- Validate that sensitivity analyses use symmetric shocks and clearly state the assumption held constant
- Cross-check EROA against asset allocation — flag if EROA exceeds the weighted-average expected return by asset class
- Confirm all [VERIFY] items have been resolved or flagged for actuarial or legal review before finalizing
