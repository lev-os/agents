# Analyzing Business Cycle Positioning

## When To Use

- Determining which phase of the business cycle an economy currently occupies (expansion, peak, contraction, trough)
- Assessing whether leading indicators signal a regime change or phase transition
- Positioning sector allocations, credit exposure, or policy recommendations relative to the cycle
- Evaluating the macro backdrop for investment committees, research notes, or policy briefings
- Stress-testing portfolio assumptions against cyclical turning points

## Inputs To Gather

- **GDP data**: Real GDP growth (quarter-over-quarter annualized, year-over-year), output gap estimates
- **Labor market**: Nonfarm payrolls trend, unemployment rate, initial jobless claims (4-week moving average), job openings-to-unemployed ratio
- **Leading indicators**: Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), OECD Composite Leading Indicators, yield curve slope (10Y–2Y, 10Y–3M), ISM New Orders minus Inventories spread
- **Credit conditions**: Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), high-yield credit spreads, bank lending standards
- **Inflation & monetary policy**: Core PCE/CPI trajectory, Fed funds rate vs. neutral rate estimate, real interest rates
- **Corporate & consumer**: Earnings revision breadth, CEO confidence surveys, consumer sentiment (Michigan/Conference Board), retail sales trend
- **Time horizon**: Whether analysis targets the current quarter, 6-month forward, or full-cycle view
- **Geographic scope**: Single-country, regional bloc, or global synchronization assessment

## Workflow

1. **Classify the current phase**
   - Map data to the four canonical phases: early expansion, late expansion, early contraction, late contraction
   - Use a composite scoring approach: assign each indicator a phase signal (e.g., LEI 6-month rate of change positive = expansion signal; inverted yield curve sustained >3 months = contraction signal)
   - Weigh leading indicators more heavily than coincident or lagging ones for forward-looking assessment
   - Note phase duration — how many months/quarters the current phase has persisted relative to historical median length [VERIFY against NBER cycle dating or equivalent national authority]

2. **Assess leading indicator momentum**
   - Track the direction and rate of change, not just the level — a falling LEI still above zero is a deterioration signal, not yet a contraction signal
   - Check for confirmation across multiple indicator categories (yield curve, credit, labor, manufacturing). Require at least 3 of 5 major categories to agree before calling a phase shift
   - Flag divergences: e.g., strong labor market but weakening ISM and tightening credit suggest late-cycle dynamics

3. **Identify inflection risk**
   - Evaluate whether the economy is mid-phase (stable positioning) or near a turning point
   - Key turning-point signals: yield curve inversion followed by re-steepening, jobless claims breaking above 4-week trend, LEI negative for 6+ consecutive months, credit spreads widening beyond 1 standard deviation from 12-month mean
   - Assign a qualitative probability (low / moderate / elevated) to a phase transition within 6–12 months

4. **Map sector and asset class implications**
   - Early expansion: cyclicals (consumer discretionary, industrials, small caps), high-yield credit, emerging markets tend to outperform
   - Late expansion: quality growth, financials (if curve steep), real assets as inflation hedges
   - Early contraction: defensives (utilities, healthcare, staples), long-duration Treasuries, investment-grade credit
   - Late contraction / trough: position for recovery — upgrade cyclical exposure as stabilization signals appear
   - [VERIFY] Sector rotation patterns are historical tendencies, not guarantees; validate against current structural factors (fiscal policy stance, sector-specific disruptions)

5. **Synthesize positioning recommendation**
   - Combine phase classification, inflection risk, and sector mapping into a coherent narrative
   - State the base case and key risks to the call
   - Specify the data releases or events that would change the assessment (e.g., "two consecutive negative payroll prints would shift our classification from late expansion to early contraction")

## Output

- **Phase classification**: Current phase with confidence level (high / moderate / low) and estimated phase age
- **Leading indicator dashboard**: Table or summary showing each key indicator, its current reading, direction of change, and phase signal
- **Inflection risk assessment**: Probability of phase transition within 6–12 months with supporting evidence
- **Sector/asset implications**: Concise mapping of phase to favored/avoided sectors and asset classes
- **Trigger watchlist**: Specific data points or thresholds that would warrant reclassification

## Quality Checks

- Verify that phase classification is supported by at least 3 independent indicator categories, not a single data series
- Confirm leading indicator data is current — stale data (more than one reporting cycle old) must be flagged
- Ensure the output distinguishes between leading, coincident, and lagging indicators rather than treating them equally
- Check that sector implications account for the current cycle's idiosyncratic features (e.g., pandemic-era distortions, fiscal dominance regimes) rather than relying purely on historical averages
- Validate yield curve and rate data against the relevant central bank's published figures [VERIFY]
- Confirm NBER (or equivalent body) dating is cited correctly when referencing historical cycle lengths [VERIFY]
- Mark any proprietary model outputs or third-party composite scores with their source and vintage date
