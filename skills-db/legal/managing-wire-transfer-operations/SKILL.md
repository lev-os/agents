# Managing Wire Transfer Operations

Structures wire transfer processing workflows including initiation verification, OFAC/sanctions screening, beneficiary validation, exception handling, and end-of-day reconciliation for domestic and international wires.

## When To Use

- Processing or reviewing individual wire transfer requests (Fedwire, SWIFT, CHIPS)
- Building or auditing wire operations procedures and controls
- Managing wire exception queues (OFAC hits, name mismatches, incomplete beneficiary info)
- Coordinating same-day or time-critical wire processing (e.g., loan fundings, real estate closings, trade settlements)
- Generating daily wire activity reports or investigating wire discrepancies
- Onboarding repetitive/standing wire instructions for commercial clients

## Inputs To Gather

- **Wire request details**: originator name and account, beneficiary name/account/bank (ABA or SWIFT/BIC), amount, currency, purpose/reference, value date
- **Authorization records**: dual-control signatures, callback verification logs, approved signor lists
- **Screening context**: OFAC/SDN list version date, any prior screening results, country-risk classification
- **Client profile**: wire agreement on file (yes/no), repetitive wire template ID if applicable, daily/transaction limits
- **Exception details** (if applicable): hold reason, screening hit details, missing fields, prior resolution attempts

## Workflow

1. **Validate wire request completeness**
   - Confirm all required fields: originator, beneficiary name, account number, routing (ABA for domestic / SWIFT BIC + intermediary for international), amount, currency, purpose
   - Verify wire authorization against approved signor list and confirm dual-control sign-off
   - For phone-initiated wires, confirm callback verification was completed to a number on file

2. **Screen for sanctions and compliance**
   - Run originator and beneficiary through OFAC/SDN, EU sanctions, and any institution-specific restricted-party lists
   - Flag transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions [VERIFY against current institution country-risk list]
   - For international wires, verify compliance with FATF travel rule requirements — originator and beneficiary information must accompany the payment message
   - Document screening results with timestamp and analyst ID

3. **Process or escalate exceptions**
   - **OFAC potential match**: Place wire on hold, document the hit details, escalate to BSA/AML officer for true-match determination within required timeframe [VERIFY institution-specific SLA, typically 2–4 hours]
   - **Beneficiary mismatch**: Contact originator for corrected details; do not process with unverified beneficiary information
   - **Limit breach**: Escalate to authorized approver for override or request client provide updated wire agreement with higher limits
   - **Cutoff time miss**: Notify originator of next-business-day processing; document reason for delay

4. **Execute wire transmission**
   - Release wire through payment platform (Fedwire, SWIFT) with dual-control release
   - Capture confirmation number / IMAD (Input Message Accountability Data) for Fedwire or SWIFT message reference
   - Provide originator with confirmation including reference number and expected value date
   - For international wires, confirm intermediary bank routing and any applicable correspondent charges (OUR/BEN/SHA)

5. **Reconcile and report**
   - Match outgoing wires against general ledger wire clearing account at end of day
   - Investigate and resolve any unmatched items before next-business-day processing
   - Generate daily wire activity report: total count, total dollar volume, exceptions processed, wires held/rejected
   - File all wire documentation (request, authorization, screening results, confirmation) per record retention policy [VERIFY retention period — typically 5 years under BSA]

## Output

- **Wire processing log**: Chronological record of each wire with status (completed, held, rejected, pending), confirmation references, and exception notes
- **Exception summary**: List of all flagged items with resolution status, escalation path taken, and time-to-resolution
- **Daily reconciliation report**: Wire clearing account balance, matched vs. unmatched items, variance explanations
- **Compliance documentation**: Screening results, OFAC disposition records, and any SAR referral notes

## Quality Checks

- Every wire has documented dual-control authorization before release
- OFAC screening results are timestamped and tied to the specific transaction — no batch-and-assume
- Beneficiary account and routing details match exactly; partial matches are treated as exceptions, not approvals
- International wires include complete originator and beneficiary information per travel rule requirements
- Cutoff times are enforced consistently; any exceptions are documented with approver sign-off [VERIFY Fedwire cutoff — typically 6:00 PM ET for standard, 6:30 PM ET for settlement]
- Wire clearing account reconciles to zero (or known pending items) at end of each business day
- All records retained per BSA/AML requirements and institution retention schedule
