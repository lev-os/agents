# Modeling Transaction Cost Optimization

Builds transaction cost models with market impact estimation, optimal trade scheduling, and turnover-adjusted returns for systematic and factor-based strategies.

## When To Use

- Estimating implementation shortfall or slippage for a proposed strategy before live deployment
- Comparing net-of-cost alpha across factor portfolios with different turnover profiles
- Designing optimal rebalance schedules (e.g., daily vs. weekly vs. monthly) given capacity constraints
- Evaluating whether a signal's gross alpha survives realistic trading friction
- Setting position-size or ADV-participation limits to manage market impact
- Benchmarking realized execution costs against pre-trade estimates (TCA reconciliation)

## Inputs To Gather

- **Universe & holdings**: Ticker list, current weights, target weights, market caps, and average daily volumes (ADV) for each name
- **Trade list**: Shares or dollar amounts to trade per name, buy/sell direction, urgency classification
- **Market microstructure data**: Bid-ask spreads (quoted and effective), tick sizes, exchange fee schedules, borrowing costs for shorts [VERIFY data vendor and snapshot date]
- **Impact model parameters**: Choose or calibrate a market impact model — common options:
  - Square-root model: impact ∝ σ × (Q / ADV)^0.5
  - Almgren-Chriss with temporary + permanent components
  - Broker-provided TCA coefficients [VERIFY broker model version]
- **Strategy parameters**: Rebalance frequency, turnover target or cap, alpha decay half-life, risk-aversion coefficient (λ)
- **Fee schedule**: Commission per share/notional, exchange/ECN fees, clearing costs, SEC fee rate [VERIFY current SEC fee rate]

## Workflow

1. **Decompose cost components**
   - Explicit costs: commissions, exchange fees, regulatory fees, taxes (stamp duty if applicable [VERIFY jurisdiction])
   - Implicit costs: half-spread crossing cost, market impact (temporary and permanent), delay/opportunity cost, alpha decay leakage
   - Compute per-name and aggregate cost estimates in basis points of notional traded

2. **Calibrate market impact model**
   - Fit the chosen impact function to historical execution data or published coefficients
   - Key inputs: daily volatility (σ), participation rate (Q/ADV), trade duration
   - Validate: compare model-predicted impact vs. realized slippage on a backtest sample; acceptable R² threshold typically > 0.3 for cross-sectional fit [VERIFY against fund's internal TCA benchmarks]

3. **Build turnover-adjusted return model**
   - Start from gross alpha forecast per rebalance period
   - Subtract estimated round-trip cost × one-way turnover for each rebalance
   - Net alpha = Gross alpha − (Turnover × Cost-per-unit-turnover)
   - Compute breakeven turnover: the turnover level at which net alpha equals zero
   - Sensitivity table: vary turnover from 50% to 500% annualized in 50% increments

4. **Optimize trade schedule**
   - For large trades (>5% ADV), model a multi-period execution plan:
     - TWAP/VWAP baseline schedule
     - Almgren-Chriss optimal trajectory minimizing E[cost] + λ × Var[cost]
   - Output participation rate per interval, expected duration, and cost confidence interval
   - Flag names where required participation rate exceeds 10% ADV as capacity-constrained

5. **Run capacity analysis**
   - Determine maximum strategy AUM at which aggregate market impact stays below a target (e.g., 25% of gross alpha)
   - Iterate: scale trade sizes proportionally, re-estimate impact at each AUM level
   - Produce a capacity curve: net alpha (y-axis) vs. AUM (x-axis)

6. **Backtest cost assumptions**
   - Replay historical rebalances using the calibrated cost model
   - Compare simulated net returns vs. gross returns to quantify implementation drag
   - Report: annualized cost drag in bps, cost as % of gross alpha, Sharpe ratio gross vs. net

## Output

Deliver a structured transaction cost model containing:

- **Cost decomposition table**: Per-name breakdown of spread, impact, commissions, fees; aggregated to portfolio level in bps
- **Turnover sensitivity matrix**: Net alpha across a range of turnover levels and cost assumptions (optimistic / base / conservative)
- **Optimal rebalance schedule**: Recommended frequency with expected cost per rebalance cycle
- **Execution plan** (for large trades): Per-name participation rates, expected completion time, cost confidence intervals
- **Capacity estimate**: Maximum AUM with net alpha remaining above a stated threshold
- **Backtest reconciliation**: Predicted vs. realized costs over the historical sample, with tracking error of cost estimates

All tables should be formatted for direct import into portfolio management or risk systems (CSV or structured data).

## Quality Checks

- Verify that impact estimates scale correctly: doubling trade size should increase impact by ~41% (square-root model) not 100%
- Confirm spread costs reflect recent market data, not stale snapshots — flag if data is >5 trading days old
- Check that turnover calculations are one-way (not double-counted) unless explicitly stated as round-trip
- Validate that the capacity curve shows diminishing net alpha — a flat or rising curve signals a model error
- Ensure short-sale costs (borrow fees, locate fees) are included for any short-leg names [VERIFY availability of borrow cost data]
- Cross-check SEC fee rate and exchange fee schedule against current published rates [VERIFY effective date]
- Confirm that alpha decay assumptions align with the signal's documented half-life — overstating decay inflates cost estimates, understating it hides implementation drag
