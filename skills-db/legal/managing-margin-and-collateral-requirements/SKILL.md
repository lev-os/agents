# Managing Margin And Collateral Requirements

## When To Use

- Calculating or reconciling initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) across cleared and bilateral OTC positions
- Evaluating portfolio margin benefits versus Reg-T margin for equity/options books
- Assessing collateral eligibility, haircuts, and substitution options for posted margin
- Responding to margin calls — determining optimal assets to pledge or liquidate
- Analyzing the margin impact of a proposed trade or portfolio rebalance before execution
- Preparing margin utilization reports for risk committees or prime broker reviews

## Inputs To Gather

- **Position data**: Current holdings by asset class, notional, instrument identifiers (CUSIP/ISIN/ticker), and clearing venue
- **Margin schedules**: Exchange/CCP margin rate tables, prime broker house requirements, ISDA SIMM parameters [VERIFY against current CCP/broker schedules]
- **Collateral inventory**: Assets available for pledging — cash balances by currency, government bonds, corporate bonds, equities, money market funds — with current market values
- **Haircut tables**: CCP and counterparty-specific haircut schedules by asset type, credit rating, tenor, and currency [VERIFY with each counterparty's current CSA/collateral annex]
- **Margin call details**: Call amounts, settlement deadlines (T+0/T+1), disputed amounts, and counterparty contact information
- **Regulatory thresholds**: Applicable IM thresholds under UMR phases, minimum transfer amounts (MTAs), and rounding conventions [VERIFY phase-in applicability for entity size]

## Workflow

1. **Aggregate positions and current margin requirements**
   - Pull positions across all clearing venues, prime brokers, and bilateral counterparties
   - Map each position to the applicable margin methodology (SPAN, TIMS, VaR-based, SIMM, Reg-T, portfolio margin)
   - Calculate gross IM and VM obligations per account/counterparty

2. **Reconcile posted collateral against requirements**
   - Compare margin required vs. margin posted per account
   - Apply correct haircuts to non-cash collateral — distinguish between CCP haircuts, bilateral CSA haircuts, and internal risk haircuts
   - Identify surplus and deficit positions; flag any accounts approaching margin call triggers

3. **Optimize collateral allocation**
   - Rank available collateral by cost: funding cost, opportunity cost of pledging, haircut drag, and concentration limits
   - Prioritize pledging lowest-cost eligible collateral (e.g., T-bills before equities)
   - Check concentration limits — many CCPs cap non-cash or single-issuer collateral at a percentage of total margin [VERIFY specific CCP concentration rules]
   - Evaluate cross-margining or netting opportunities across correlated positions at the same CCP

4. **Analyze portfolio margin optimization**
   - Compare Reg-T margin to portfolio margin (PM) requirements for options/equity strategies
   - Quantify margin savings from PM approval — model stress scenarios (typically ±6% to ±15% moves) used by OCC/exchange PM calculations [VERIFY current PM stress parameters]
   - Identify positions that increase margin disproportionately under PM (e.g., concentrated single-name risk, illiquid underlyings)
   - Flag eligibility requirements: account minimums, product restrictions, and broker-specific PM rules

5. **Process margin calls and substitutions**
   - For inbound margin calls: verify call accuracy against independent calculations, note dispute window deadlines
   - Select assets to pledge based on optimization ranking from Step 3
   - For collateral substitutions: confirm counterparty accepts replacement asset, coordinate settlement timing to avoid uncollateralized gaps
   - Document all margin movements with timestamps, counterparty confirmations, and settlement references

6. **Report and escalate**
   - Produce margin utilization summary: total IM/VM posted, surplus/deficit by counterparty, cost of collateral deployed
   - Highlight approaching thresholds — accounts within 10–20% of margin call triggers
   - Escalate breaches, disputed calls, or collateral shortfalls to risk management and treasury

## Output

The final margin and collateral report should include:

- **Margin summary table**: Counterparty/CCP, margin methodology, IM required, VM required, collateral posted (cash vs. non-cash), surplus/deficit
- **Collateral allocation detail**: Assets pledged by counterparty, haircut applied, eligible value credited, funding cost estimate
- **Portfolio margin analysis** (if applicable): Reg-T vs. PM comparison, margin savings quantified, stress-test results under PM methodology
- **Margin call log**: Open calls with amounts, deadlines, resolution status, and any disputed items
- **Optimization recommendations**: Collateral substitutions that would reduce funding cost, cross-margining opportunities, positions to restructure for margin efficiency
- **Risk flags**: Concentrated collateral exposure, upcoming large expirations affecting margin, counterparties with deteriorating collateral quality

## Quality Checks

- Verify margin calculations against at least one independent source (CCP margin calculator, broker portal, or internal risk system)
- Confirm haircut schedules match the governing CSA, clearing agreement, or exchange rulebook — do not assume standard haircuts [VERIFY]
- Validate that collateral eligibility reflects current counterparty schedules, not stale lists
- Check settlement timing — ensure collateral delivery meets margin call deadlines accounting for settlement lag (same-day for cash, T+1/T+2 for securities)
- Confirm no double-counting of collateral pledged to multiple counterparties
- Cross-check that portfolio margin stress scenarios use current exchange-published parameters, not historical defaults [VERIFY]
- Flag any regulatory threshold changes (UMR phase-in, updated SIMM calibration) that affect margin calculations
