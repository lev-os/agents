# Analyzing Total Return Swaps

## When To Use

- Evaluating a proposed TRS to determine funding advantage over cash acquisition of the reference asset
- Comparing synthetic exposure via TRS against direct ownership for regulatory capital, balance sheet, or tax purposes
- Assessing counterparty credit exposure and margin/collateral adequacy on an existing TRS book
- Analyzing unwind or novation scenarios for a TRS position
- Reviewing TRS terms in the context of a structured financing, prime brokerage arrangement, or leveraged fund strategy

## Inputs To Gather

- **TRS term sheet or confirmation**: Notional amount, reference asset(s), total return leg details, funding leg spread (SOFR/EURIBOR + basis points), payment frequency, reset dates, maturity
- **Reference asset data**: Current market price, coupon/dividend schedule, historical volatility, credit rating, liquidity profile
- **Funding comparison**: Entity's unsecured borrowing cost, repo rate on the reference asset, margin loan rate if applicable
- **Counterparty information**: Credit rating of TRS dealer, ISDA master agreement terms, CSA thresholds, initial margin and variation margin requirements
- **Regulatory context**: Whether the entity is subject to Basel III/IV leverage ratio, SEC 15a-6 considerations, or Dodd-Frank swap reporting [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific reporting and clearing obligations]
- **Accounting treatment**: Whether the TRS qualifies for hedge accounting or must be marked to market through P&L [VERIFY under IFRS 9 / ASC 815 as applicable]

## Workflow

1. **Map the TRS economics**
   - Diagram cash flows: total return receiver gets asset appreciation + coupons/dividends; total return payer receives funding rate + spread and any asset depreciation
   - Confirm payment netting mechanics and settlement timing (cash vs. physical settlement at maturity)
   - Identify embedded optionality (early termination rights, substitution rights, rate reset provisions)

2. **Calculate funding benefit**
   - Compare the TRS funding spread to the entity's alternative cost of financing the same position (unsecured debt, repo, margin loan)
   - Compute net funding advantage: `Funding benefit (bps) = Alternative cost - TRS spread`
   - Quantify the dollar benefit over the TRS tenor on the notional amount
   - Factor in upfront costs (legal, ISDA negotiation) and ongoing operational costs

3. **Assess economic equivalence to cash position**
   - Compare P&L profile of TRS receiver vs. outright holder across scenarios (price up, flat, down)
   - Identify divergences: dividend withholding treatment, voting rights forfeiture, corporate action handling, early termination triggers
   - Evaluate balance sheet impact — TRS typically keeps the reference asset off-balance-sheet for the receiver [VERIFY under applicable accounting standards]
   - Assess regulatory capital treatment: whether TRS creates synthetic leverage that increases leverage ratio denominators [VERIFY under Basel III/IV framework applicable to the entity]

4. **Quantify counterparty exposure**
   - Calculate current exposure (mark-to-market value of the TRS)
   - Estimate potential future exposure (PFE) using reference asset volatility and remaining tenor
   - Review collateral arrangements: CSA threshold, minimum transfer amount, eligible collateral haircuts
   - Stress test: model exposure under a 2-3 standard deviation move in the reference asset combined with counterparty credit deterioration
   - Assess wrong-way risk — correlation between reference asset decline and counterparty default probability

5. **Evaluate risk factors and sensitivities**
   - Interest rate sensitivity: impact of funding rate moves on net carry
   - Credit spread sensitivity: widening of reference asset credit spread vs. counterparty spread
   - Liquidity risk: ability to unwind or novate the TRS if the reference asset becomes illiquid
   - Basis risk: divergence between TRS economic return and actual reference asset total return (due to valuation agent discretion, corporate action handling)
   - Termination risk: consequences of early termination events (NAV triggers, ratings downgrades, change of control)

6. **Compile analysis and recommendations**
   - Summarize funding benefit, economic equivalence assessment, and counterparty exposure in a structured report
   - Provide scenario analysis table showing P&L and exposure under base, upside, and stress cases
   - Flag any structural terms that create asymmetric risk
   - Recommend position sizing, collateral optimization, or structural modifications if warranted

## Output

The deliverable is a **TRS Analysis Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: One-paragraph conclusion on whether the TRS is economically advantageous vs. alternatives
- **Term summary table**: Key commercial terms in tabular format (notional, spread, tenor, reference asset, settlement type)
- **Funding benefit analysis**: Quantified advantage/disadvantage in basis points and dollar terms
- **Economic equivalence comparison**: Side-by-side of TRS vs. cash ownership across tax, accounting, regulatory capital, and governance dimensions
- **Counterparty exposure profile**: Current exposure, PFE at 95th/99th percentile, collateral coverage ratio
- **Scenario/sensitivity tables**: At minimum three scenarios (base, favorable, adverse) showing P&L and exposure metrics
- **Risk flags and recommendations**: Actionable items ranked by materiality

## Quality Checks

- Verify that the TRS funding spread and reference rates match the term sheet exactly — transposition errors in basis points are common
- Confirm that the funding benefit calculation uses the correct day-count convention (ACT/360 vs. 30/360) consistent with the TRS confirmation [VERIFY]
- Ensure counterparty exposure calculations account for netting across all trades under the same ISDA master, not just the single TRS
- Cross-check that accounting and regulatory capital conclusions cite the applicable standard and are reviewed against the entity's specific regulatory status
- Validate that scenario analysis uses internally consistent assumptions (e.g., a credit stress scenario should stress both the reference asset spread and the counterparty credit simultaneously)
- Confirm all [VERIFY] items have been reviewed against current jurisdiction-specific rules before finalizing
