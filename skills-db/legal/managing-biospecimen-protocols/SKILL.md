# Managing Biospecimen Protocols

## Why This Skill Exists

Biospecimen collection, processing, storage, and tracking are critical components of clinical trials and translational research. Poor specimen management — incorrect processing, broken cold chain, mislabeling, inadequate chain of custody — renders biomarker, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data useless and can invalidate primary endpoints in studies where biospecimen-derived data drive regulatory decisions. This skill implements ISBER (International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories) best practices, NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources, CAP/CLIA laboratory requirements, and ICH-GCP documentation standards for biospecimen management in clinical research.

## Checkpoint A — Intake and Scoping

### Required Intake Questions
1. What types of biospecimens are collected (blood — whole blood, serum, plasma, PBMCs; urine; tissue — fresh, frozen, FFPE; CSF; bone marrow; other)?
2. What assays/analyses will be performed on the specimens (PK, PD biomarkers, genomics, flow cytometry, histopathology, ctDNA)?
3. What are the processing requirements (centrifugation speed/time/temperature, aliquoting, fixation, stabilization)?
4. What are the stability requirements and maximum processing windows (time from collection to processing)?
5. Where are specimens analyzed (central lab, local lab, sponsor lab, academic core facility)?
6. What shipping requirements apply (ambient, cold pack, dry ice, liquid nitrogen)?
7. What labeling system is used (barcoded, RFID, manual)?
8. What LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) or sample-tracking database is used?
9. Are there consent-specific restrictions on specimen use (current study only, future research, genetic analysis permitted)?
10. What regulatory requirements apply (CLIA/CAP for US labs, ISO 15189, GLP for certain analyses)?

### Required Source Documents
- Protocol (biospecimen collection section and Schedule of Assessments)
- Laboratory Manual (specimen-specific processing instructions)
- Central lab kit order form and shipping instructions
- Consent form (biospecimen and genetic-data clauses)
- Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) if specimens are shared between institutions
- LIMS user guide and access credentials
- Site-specific laboratory certifications (CLIA, CAP)
- Cold-chain monitoring equipment specifications

## Step 1 — Design the Collection Protocol

For each specimen type, define the complete collection procedure:

### Blood Specimens
| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tube type | Specify color-top and anticoagulant (EDTA lavender, sodium heparin green, citrate blue, SST gold, PAXgene RNA) |
| Volume | Per tube and total per visit (do not exceed safe limits — typically 450 mL per 8-week period for adults) |
| Collection order | Follow CLSI H3-A6 order of draw to avoid cross-contamination |
| Fasting requirement | Specify if fasting is required and minimum fasting duration |
| Processing time | Maximum time from collection to processing (e.g., centrifuge within 30 minutes) |
| Centrifugation | Speed (×g, not RPM), duration, temperature (e.g., 1500 ×g, 10 min, 4°C) |
| Aliquoting | Number of aliquots, volume per aliquot, tube type for storage |
| Stabilization | Special handling (e.g., PAXgene tubes must be inverted 10×, stored upright at RT for 2 hours before freezing) |

### Tissue Specimens
- Fresh-frozen: Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen within X minutes of excision; maintain at −80°C or below
- FFPE: Fix in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6-72 hours (specify exact duration per protocol); process and embed per standard histology protocols
- Document ischemia times (warm ischemia, cold ischemia) — these affect biomarker validity

### Urine Specimens
- Spot vs. timed collection; preservative requirements; volume and aliquoting; temperature during collection

### Other Specimens (CSF, bone marrow, saliva, stool)
- Specimen-specific collection devices, volumes, processing steps, and stability windows

## Step 2 — Implement Labeling and Identification

Design a labeling system that ensures traceability from participant to analysis result:

1. **Label content**: Unique specimen ID (linked to participant but de-identified), specimen type, collection date/time, visit number, aliquot number
2. **Label format**: Pre-printed barcoded labels (2D barcode preferred); cryogenic labels for frozen specimens (must withstand −80°C or LN2 temperatures without degrading)
3. **ID linking**: Specimen ID linked to participant ID in a secure, access-controlled database; de-identification per HIPAA and protocol consent requirements
4. **Label generation**: Generate labels before the study visit; include extra labels for unplanned collections
5. **Verification**: Two-person verification (collector + verifier) at point of collection — confirm participant identity and label match
6. **Relabeling procedures**: If relabeling is ever required (damaged label), document the old and new IDs with date, reason, and personnel

---

## Step 3 — Establish Chain of Custody

Document specimen custody at every handoff:

1. **Collection**: Date, time, collector name/initials, participant ID, specimens collected
2. **Processing**: Date, time, processor name, procedures performed (centrifugation parameters, aliquoting, freezing method)
3. **Storage**: Date/time placed in storage, storage location (freezer ID, rack, box, position), temperature
4. **Retrieval**: Date/time retrieved, requester, purpose, destination
5. **Shipping**: Date shipped, carrier (FedEx, World Courier, CRYOPORT), tracking number, packaging type, temperature monitor included (data-logger ID)
6. **Receipt at destination**: Date/time received, condition on arrival (temperature log review, visual inspection for thawing/damage), receiving personnel name

Maintain chain-of-custody logs per ICH-GCP requirements — these are essential documents for the Trial Master File.

## Step 4 — Manage Storage and Cold Chain

### Storage Requirements by Specimen Type
| Specimen | Temperature | Duration |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Serum/plasma (short-term) | −20°C | Up to 30 days |
| Serum/plasma (long-term) | −80°C or below | Years |
| Whole blood (same-day processing) | Room temperature | <6 hours |
| PBMCs | Liquid nitrogen (−196°C) | Years |
| FFPE tissue | Room temperature | Years |
| Fresh-frozen tissue | −80°C or LN2 | Years |
| RNA (PAXgene) | −80°C after initial RT stabilization | Years |

### Cold-Chain Monitoring
1. **Continuous temperature monitoring**: Digital data-loggers on all research freezers (−20°C, −80°C) and LN2 tanks
2. **Alarm systems**: Audible and remote alarms (email/SMS) for temperature excursions; define response times and escalation procedures
3. **Backup power**: Freezers on emergency generator circuits; backup LN2 supply for cryogenic storage
4. **Excursion management**: Document any temperature excursion (date, duration, max temperature reached, affected specimens, impact assessment, corrective action)
5. **Calibration**: Annual calibration of temperature-monitoring equipment with documented certificates

## Step 5 — Manage Shipping and Receiving

### Outbound Shipping
1. **Packaging**: IATA-compliant packaging for Category B biological substances (UN3373); use validated shipping containers with gel packs, dry ice, or LN2 dry shippers as required
2. **Documentation**: Shipping manifest (specimen IDs, type, quantity), chain-of-custody transfer form, temperature monitor, required regulatory documents (import permits if international)
3. **Dry ice quantity**: Calculate based on transit time + 24-hour buffer; document weight at time of packing
4. **Carrier selection**: Validated courier with clinical-trial experience; priority/overnight service with tracking
5. **Scheduling**: Ship Monday-Wednesday to avoid weekend delays (unless weekend delivery is guaranteed)

### Inbound Receiving
1. **Inspection**: Verify package integrity, remaining dry ice or cold-pack condition, temperature-logger reading
2. **Reconciliation**: Match received specimens against shipping manifest; document discrepancies
3. **Condition assessment**: Document any compromised specimens (thawed, hemolyzed, insufficient volume, broken container)
4. **Storage**: Place in appropriate storage within 30 minutes of receipt; log in LIMS

## Step 6 — Manage Specimen Lifecycle

Track specimens from collection through final disposition:

1. **Inventory management**: Real-time LIMS tracking of every aliquot's location, status, and availability
2. **Testing/analysis requests**: Formal requisition process with authorization, purpose, and specimen-return expectations
3. **Freeze-thaw tracking**: Record every freeze-thaw cycle (minimize; most assays tolerate 1-3 cycles)
4. **Specimen depletion**: Document when specimens are fully consumed; update inventory
5. **Retention period**: Per protocol and regulatory requirements (typically 2 years after NDA approval or study termination; longer for pivotal biomarker samples)
6. **Destruction**: Document destruction per protocol and consent; obtain sponsor authorization; use witnessed destruction with documentation

## Guidelines

1. Never collect specimens without confirmed consent for the specific collection — biobank consent and clinical-trial consent may differ
2. Processing time windows are non-negotiable for analyte stability — a PK sample processed outside the window produces unreliable data
3. Cold-chain breaks must be investigated and documented immediately — do not assume specimens are unaffected without evidence
4. Two-person verification at collection is a critical safety control — mislabeled specimens cannot be corrected
5. Dry ice quantities must account for transit delays — always add a 24-hour buffer
6. International specimen shipments require advance planning for import permits, customs clearance, and CITES regulations (if applicable)
7. Specimen destruction requires sponsor authorization and documented witness — never discard research specimens without formal approval
8. For genetic specimens, verify that the consent explicitly permits genetic/genomic analysis and specify data-return policies
9. Mark any temperature excursion or specimen-integrity concern with [VERIFY] for laboratory-director and medical-monitor review
10. This skill produces biospecimen-management protocols — laboratory validation, assay qualification, and result interpretation require qualified laboratory scientists
