# Analyzing Debt Capacity And Structure

Evaluates target leverage capacity with cash flow coverage, stress testing, and optimal debt structure across term loans, revolver, and mezzanine.

## When To Use

- Sizing acquisition debt for an LBO or growth equity recapitalization
- Evaluating how much leverage a target's cash flows can support under base and downside scenarios
- Structuring a multi-tranche debt package (senior term loan, revolver, second lien, mezzanine/sub debt)
- Stress testing an existing or proposed capital structure against covenant thresholds
- Preparing debt-capacity sections for investment committee memos or lender presentations

## Inputs To Gather

- **Historical financials**: 3-5 years of revenue, EBITDA, capex, working capital changes, and debt service history
- **Management projections or model**: Base-case P&L and cash flow forecast (minimum 5-year horizon)
- **Existing debt terms**: Outstanding balances, maturities, pricing, amortization schedules, and covenant packages
- **Comparable transaction leverage data**: Leverage multiples, pricing, and structures from recent precedent deals in the sector
- **Lender feedback** (if available): Indicative terms, hold sizes, or commitment letters
- **Asset base detail**: If asset-based lending is relevant — AR, inventory, PP&E appraisals
- **Sponsor equity check size and target returns**: Required IRR/MOIC driving the leverage need

## Workflow

1. **Normalize EBITDA and free cash flow**
   - Adjust for non-recurring items, run-rate synergies (haircut aggressively), and pro-forma cost structure
   - Calculate unlevered free cash flow (EBITDA − cash taxes − capex − change in NWC) as the base debt-service pool
   - Flag any add-backs exceeding 15-20% of reported EBITDA as [VERIFY] items for diligence

2. **Determine maximum leverage capacity**
   - Apply sector-appropriate leverage ceilings: Total Debt / EBITDA, Senior Debt / EBITDA, Net Debt / EBITDA
   - Cross-check against fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR ≥ 1.0-1.2x) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR ≥ 1.5-2.0x) [VERIFY — lender-specific minimums vary]
   - Benchmark against precedent transaction leverage for the sub-sector and credit-quality tier

3. **Structure the debt tranches**
   - **Revolver**: Size to cover seasonal working capital swings plus a liquidity cushion (typically 1.0-1.5x peak seasonal draw); confirm borrowing base if ABL
   - **Senior term loan (TLA/TLB)**: Size based on senior leverage target (typically 3.0-5.0x for middle-market; up to 6.0x+ for large-cap) [VERIFY — market-dependent]; set amortization (1-5% p.a. for TLB, higher for TLA)
   - **Second lien / mezzanine / sub debt**: Layer in to bridge the gap between senior capacity and total leverage need; note pricing step-up (typically 300-600 bps over first lien) and PIK toggle structures
   - **Seller notes or earnouts**: Consider as quasi-debt capacity if terms are favorable and subordination is clear

4. **Run stress tests and downside scenarios**
   - Revenue decline case: Model 10-20% revenue shortfall in Year 1-2 and check covenant headroom
   - Margin compression case: EBITDA margins contract 200-500 bps from base case
   - Combined downside: Simultaneous revenue miss + margin compression + capex overrun
   - For each scenario, calculate: leverage ratchet compliance, FCCR/DSCR, cash balance trajectory, and revolver availability
   - Identify the break-even EBITDA at which the capital structure triggers a covenant default

5. **Assess covenant package and structural protections**
   - Map financial maintenance covenants (leverage ratio, FCCR, minimum liquidity) against projected performance with cushion analysis (target ≥15-25% headroom)
   - Review incurrence covenants for permitted debt, restricted payments, and lien baskets
   - Evaluate call protection, prepayment penalties, and refinancing flexibility
   - Note any springing covenants or reclassification triggers [VERIFY — document-specific]

6. **Summarize optimal structure and recommendations**
   - Present recommended debt quantum by tranche with blended cost of debt
   - Show leverage walk: Entry leverage → Year 1 → Year 3 → Exit, with deleveraging trajectory
   - Highlight key risks and mitigants (cyclicality, customer concentration, capex lumpiness)
   - Provide sensitivity table: EBITDA vs. leverage multiple showing debt capacity range

## Output

- **Debt capacity summary table**: Maximum supportable debt by tranche, leverage multiples, coverage ratios at entry
- **Sources and uses**: Full capital structure with equity check, rollover equity, and debt breakdown
- **Stress test matrix**: Base, downside, and severe downside scenarios with key coverage and liquidity metrics per year
- **Covenant compliance dashboard**: Projected covenant metrics vs. thresholds with headroom percentages
- **Recommendation narrative**: 1-2 page summary of recommended structure, key sensitivities, and open diligence items

## Quality Checks

- EBITDA add-backs are individually justified and sourced — no unsubstantiated management adjustments
- Leverage multiples are cross-referenced against at least 3 comparable precedent transactions
- Stress tests produce a clear break-even EBITDA level, not just directional commentary
- Coverage ratios are calculated on a cash (not accrual) basis, with capex treated as a real cash outflow
- All lender-specific covenant thresholds and market-dependent pricing assumptions are marked [VERIFY]
- Debt maturity profile avoids concentration — no single year with >40% of total debt maturing
- Blended cost of debt is internally consistent with tranche-level pricing and fees
