# Managing Subsidiary Financing

Structures subsidiary-level financing at the operating-company level, evaluating upstream guarantee requirements, structural subordination risk, and intercompany cash-flow mechanics across multi-entity corporate groups.

## When To Use

- A subsidiary (operating co, project co, or JV entity) needs external debt or credit facilities independent of or alongside parent-level financing
- Treasury is evaluating whether to push financing down-structure vs. on-lending from the parent
- An existing subsidiary facility requires refinancing, amendment, or guarantee restructuring
- Lenders or rating agencies request structural subordination analysis for a new issuance
- A cross-border subsidiary needs local-currency financing with upstream guarantee or keepwell support

## Inputs To Gather

- **Corporate org chart** — full legal-entity hierarchy showing ownership percentages, jurisdiction of incorporation, and any minority interests
- **Existing debt schedule** — all parent and subsidiary indebtedness, including intercompany loans, with maturity dates, rates, covenants, and cross-default/cross-acceleration provisions
- **Subsidiary financials** — standalone P&L, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement for the borrowing entity (minimum trailing 12 months plus current period)
- **Guarantee and security inventory** — existing upstream, downstream, and cross-stream guarantees; pledged collateral; negative pledge restrictions
- **Credit agreement restrictions** — permitted indebtedness baskets, restricted payments, investment covenant headroom at parent and subsidiary levels
- **Target financing terms** — amount, tenor, currency, fixed vs. floating preference, security package expectations, and use of proceeds
- **Tax and regulatory considerations** — thin-capitalization rules, withholding tax on interest, transfer pricing requirements, and local capital adequacy rules [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific thresholds]

## Workflow

1. **Map the structural position**
   - Place the borrowing subsidiary within the org chart and identify all entities that sit above, below, and alongside it
   - Determine which entity holds the revenue-generating assets and where cash is generated vs. where debt will sit
   - Flag minority interests — upstream guarantees from a partially-owned sub create fiduciary and fraudulent-conveyance risk

2. **Assess structural subordination exposure**
   - Compare the subsidiary's standalone debt capacity (unlevered cash flow, asset base) against the proposed financing
   - Identify senior claims at the subsidiary level (trade payables, local tax obligations, pension liabilities) that rank ahead of unsecured lenders
   - Quantify the "leakage" — how much subsidiary cash must satisfy local obligations before servicing parent-level debt or dividends

3. **Analyze guarantee structures**
   - Evaluate upstream guarantee feasibility: net-assets limitation, reasonably equivalent value tests, and corporate-benefit doctrine [VERIFY under applicable state/country fraudulent transfer law]
   - For cross-border guarantees, confirm enforceability in the guarantor's jurisdiction, assess financial-assistance prohibitions, and check withholding-tax implications on guarantee fees
   - Determine whether a keepwell agreement, equity commitment letter, or hard guarantee best fits the credit profile and legal constraints
   - Size guarantee caps where full-value guarantees are not legally supportable (typically limited to net assets at time of guarantee)

4. **Model intercompany cash flows**
   - Build a waterfall showing subsidiary operating cash flow → local debt service → tax distributions → management fees → dividends to parent
   - Stress-test the waterfall under downside scenarios (revenue decline of 20–30%, margin compression, FX depreciation for cross-border subs)
   - Confirm dividend and distribution capacity under subsidiary-level restricted-payment covenants and local corporate-law requirements [VERIFY solvency-test and surplus-test rules by jurisdiction]

5. **Negotiate and document the facility**
   - Draft or review the subsidiary credit agreement, guarantee agreement, and any intercompany subordination agreements
   - Ensure cross-default thresholds are set appropriately — a subsidiary default should not trigger acceleration at the parent unless intended
   - Coordinate with treasury on cash-management mechanics: whether the subsidiary joins the parent's cash-pooling structure or maintains segregated accounts

6. **Establish ongoing monitoring**
   - Set subsidiary-level compliance reporting cadence (quarterly covenant certificates, annual audited financials)
   - Create a trigger dashboard for early-warning metrics: debt-service coverage ratio < 1.25x, leverage > agreed threshold, liquidity below minimum
   - Calendar guarantee renewal dates, facility maturity, and any springing covenants

## Output

Produce a **Subsidiary Financing Management Report** containing:

- **Executive summary** — financing rationale, amount, key terms, and structural recommendation (sub-level borrowing vs. parent on-lending)
- **Structural subordination analysis** — priority-of-claims waterfall at the subsidiary level with quantified senior obligations
- **Guarantee structure recommendation** — type of credit support (upstream guarantee, keepwell, equity commitment), sizing, and legal-limitation analysis
- **Intercompany cash-flow model** — base-case and stress-case waterfall with dividend capacity projections
- **Covenant compliance matrix** — existing and proposed covenant levels at both parent and subsidiary, with headroom calculations
- **Risk register** — key risks (FX, regulatory, cross-default contagion, minority-interest disputes) with mitigants
- **Action items** — next steps with responsible parties and deadlines

## Quality Checks

- Org-chart ownership percentages foot to 100% at each level; minority interests are explicitly identified
- Guarantee analysis addresses fraudulent-transfer / financial-assistance risk under applicable law — do not assume U.S. law applies to foreign subs [VERIFY]
- Intercompany cash-flow model ties to subsidiary standalone financials and parent consolidated statements
- Covenant headroom calculations use the same definition of EBITDA or cash flow as the underlying credit agreement (adjusted vs. unadjusted)
- Cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions are mapped across all facilities in the group — no orphaned triggers
- Thin-capitalization and transfer-pricing limits on intercompany interest are confirmed with tax advisors [VERIFY]
- All currency amounts specify denomination; FX assumptions are stated and sourced
