# Managing Digital Wallet Operations

Structures digital wallet analysis with stored value, regulatory classification, and risk assessment.

## When To Use

- Evaluating a new or existing digital wallet product for regulatory classification (closed-loop, semi-open, open-loop)
- Assessing stored value compliance under state money transmitter laws or federal e-money regulations
- Onboarding a wallet provider or partner and documenting operational risk
- Conducting periodic compliance reviews of wallet funding sources, transaction limits, and consumer protections
- Preparing management reports on wallet portfolio health, fraud exposure, or dormancy/escheatment obligations

## Inputs To Gather

- **Wallet product specification**: Funding methods (ACH, debit, credit, crypto), supported currencies, stored value model (prefunded vs. pass-through)
- **Regulatory filings**: State money transmitter licenses held, FinCEN MSB registration status, any exemption claims (bank-partner model, agent-of-the-payee) [VERIFY jurisdictions where exemptions are claimed]
- **Transaction data**: Volume and velocity metrics, average balance per wallet, top-up and withdrawal patterns
- **Risk and fraud reports**: Chargeback rates, unauthorized transaction claims, AML/KYC alert volumes
- **Consumer-facing disclosures**: Fee schedules, error resolution procedures, EFTA/Regulation E compliance documentation
- **Partner and vendor agreements**: Bank sponsor contracts, processor SLAs, program manager responsibilities
- **Escheatment/dormancy records**: State-by-state dormancy periods and last-activity dates for inactive wallets [VERIFY applicable state unclaimed property statutes]

## Workflow

1. **Classify the wallet product**
   - Determine if the wallet holds stored value (prefunded balance) or operates as a pass-through payment credential
   - Map to regulatory category: closed-loop (merchant-specific), semi-open (limited network), or open-loop (general purpose)
   - Identify whether the operator, bank partner, or a third party bears the money transmission obligation [VERIFY state-by-state MTL requirements]

2. **Assess regulatory posture**
   - Confirm FinCEN MSB registration and SAR/CTR filing obligations
   - Review state money transmitter license coverage against states where wallets are offered
   - Evaluate Regulation E compliance: error resolution timelines, provisional credit policies, periodic statement or electronic history access
   - Check CFPB prepaid account rule applicability (short-form and long-form disclosures, fee harvesting limits) [VERIFY if Regulation E Prepaid Accounts Rule applies based on product structure]

3. **Evaluate operational controls**
   - Review KYC/CIP tiers: anonymous (limited functionality), verified (full access), enhanced (high-value)
   - Assess transaction monitoring rules — thresholds for velocity, geography, device fingerprinting
   - Document funding source controls: ACH return rates, card chargeback exposure, fraud scoring on loads
   - Review balance limits, daily transaction caps, and cross-border restrictions

4. **Analyze financial health and risk metrics**
   - Calculate held-balance float and interest income implications (trust account or FBO account structure)
   - Quantify fraud loss rates as a percentage of gross dollar volume
   - Assess dormancy exposure: number and aggregate value of wallets approaching escheatment triggers
   - Review reserve and collateral requirements under bank sponsor agreements

5. **Compile management report**
   - Summarize wallet classification, regulatory status, and any gaps or pending actions
   - Present key risk indicators with trend data (fraud rates, complaint volumes, regulatory exam findings)
   - Recommend corrective actions with owners and deadlines
   - Flag items requiring escalation to compliance committee or board

## Output

The deliverable is a **Digital Wallet Operations Report** containing:

- **Product classification matrix**: Each wallet product mapped to its regulatory category, license coverage, and responsible entity
- **Compliance gap analysis**: Identified deficiencies in licensing, disclosures, or consumer protection with remediation steps
- **Risk dashboard**: Fraud loss rate, chargeback ratio, AML alert-to-SAR conversion rate, dormancy/escheatment exposure
- **Operational controls summary**: KYC tier structure, transaction limits, funding source risk controls
- **Action items register**: Open items with priority, owner, and target completion date

## Quality Checks

- Confirm wallet classification aligns with actual fund flow (not just marketing descriptions) — trace a transaction end-to-end
- Verify that every state where wallets are actively held has been checked for MTL coverage [VERIFY]
- Ensure Regulation E error resolution timelines match current regulatory requirements (10 business days for investigation, 45 calendar days extended) [VERIFY for any recent amendments]
- Cross-check dormancy periods against each applicable state's unclaimed property statute — do not assume a uniform period [VERIFY]
- Validate that fraud and transaction metrics are pulled from the same reporting period for consistency
- Confirm bank sponsor FBO account structure is documented and reconciliation frequency is stated
- Flag any wallet feature (e.g., crypto funding, cross-border P2P) that may trigger additional regulatory requirements not covered in the base analysis
