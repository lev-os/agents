# Structuring Inflation Derivatives

Designs inflation swap and option structures analyzing zero-coupon vs. year-on-year mechanics, seasonal adjustment patterns, and index-linking conventions to produce actionable hedging and pricing recommendations.

## When To Use

- Structuring zero-coupon inflation swaps (ZCIS) or year-on-year (YoY) inflation swaps for liability hedging or speculative positioning
- Pricing inflation caps, floors, or collars for pension funds, insurers, or corporates with inflation-linked obligations
- Evaluating real-rate exposure and breakeven inflation across tenors
- Assessing seasonal adjustment impact on CPI/RPI/HICP-linked structures
- Comparing inflation swap economics against inflation-linked bond (linker) alternatives
- Designing structured notes with embedded inflation optionality

## Inputs To Gather

- **Reference index**: CPI-U, RPI, HICP (eurozone), CPIH, or custom basket — including publication lag (typically 2–3 months) [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific index and lag]
- **Notional and tenor**: Trade size, maturity date, and whether amortizing or bullet
- **Structure type**: Zero-coupon swap, YoY swap, cap/floor, collar, limited price index (LPI), or hybrid
- **Base index value**: The fixing at trade inception (or forward-starting reference date)
- **Fixed rate or strike**: Target breakeven rate, cap strike, floor strike
- **Counterparty credit profile**: CSA terms, margin thresholds, eligible collateral
- **Hedging objective**: Liability matching (e.g., pension real-rate obligation), budget certainty, or relative-value trade
- **Seasonal data**: At least 10 years of monthly index values for seasonal decomposition
- **Market data**: Current inflation swap curve, inflation vol surface (if options involved), nominal swap curve for discounting

## Workflow

1. **Define the hedging or structuring objective**
   - Identify the underlying inflation exposure: inflation-linked pension liabilities, real-rate revenue streams, or CPI-escalated lease payments
   - Determine whether the goal is full hedge, partial hedge, or leveraged exposure
   - Confirm the appropriate reference index and any basis risk between the exposure index and tradable index

2. **Select structure type and mechanics**
   - **Zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS)**: Single exchange at maturity of compounded inflation vs. fixed — suited for long-dated liability matching with no interim cash flows
   - **Year-on-year (YoY) swap**: Annual payments based on each year's inflation rate — suited for matching periodic cash flow needs or when interim mark-to-market matters
   - **Inflation cap/floor**: Option-based protection — cap for payers worried about inflation spikes; floor for receivers protecting against deflation
   - **LPI swap**: Capped-and-floored inflation (common in UK pensions, e.g., 0%–5% RPI) [VERIFY applicable LPI parameters by scheme]
   - **Collar**: Simultaneous cap purchase and floor sale to reduce premium

3. **Perform seasonal adjustment analysis**
   - Decompose the reference index into trend, seasonal, and residual components using X-13 or similar methodology
   - Identify months with systematic seasonal bias (e.g., January clothing sales, energy-driven winter spikes)
   - Quantify the impact of seasonality on forward index projections at each fixing date
   - Adjust breakeven calculations for seasonal patterns — critical for YoY structures where each annual fixing captures different seasonal months

4. **Build the inflation curve and price the structure**
   - Bootstrap the zero-coupon inflation swap curve from market quotes
   - Derive forward inflation rates for each period
   - For ZCIS: calculate the implied compounded inflation rate and compare to target fixed rate
   - For YoY swaps: project each annual inflation leg using forward rates with seasonal overlay
   - For options: calibrate an inflation vol model (typically lognormal or Bachelier on the inflation rate) to market cap/floor prices, then price the target structure
   - Apply convexity adjustment between ZCIS and YoY rates where necessary

5. **Assess economics, risks, and alternatives**
   - Compare all-in cost to inflation-linked bond breakevens (asset-swap spread differential)
   - Quantify DV01 (real-rate sensitivity) and IE01 (inflation expectation sensitivity)
   - Stress-test under scenarios: deflation shock, inflation spike (+200 bps), seasonal pattern shift
   - Evaluate counterparty credit exposure profile and CSA margining impact
   - Consider funding cost of collateral posting vs. uncollateralized execution
   - Flag any index cessation risk (e.g., RPI reform/CPIH transition in the UK) [VERIFY current status of index reform timelines]

6. **Document structure and deliver recommendation**
   - Produce a term sheet with all economic terms, fixing conventions, and fallback provisions
   - Include scenario analysis table showing P&L under base, upside, and downside inflation paths
   - Provide comparison matrix if multiple structures were evaluated
   - Note all assumptions, model limitations, and areas requiring [VERIFY]

## Output

- **Structure recommendation memo** including:
  - Recommended structure type with rationale tied to hedging objective
  - Full term sheet: notional, tenor, reference index, base index, fixed rate/strike, payment dates, day count, business day convention
  - Inflation curve used (date, source, key tenor points)
  - Seasonal adjustment methodology and impact quantification
  - Pricing summary: mid-market value, bid/offer spread estimate, upfront premium (if options)
  - Risk metrics: DV01, IE01, gamma (for options), max collateral call estimate
  - Scenario analysis: base case, +/−100 bps inflation shock, deflation floor trigger
  - Comparison to alternative hedging instruments (linkers, inflation ETFs, breakeven trades)

## Quality Checks

- Confirm the reference index, publication lag, and interpolation method match market convention for the jurisdiction [VERIFY]
- Validate that seasonal factors sum correctly (multiplicative factors average to 1.0 over 12 months)
- Cross-check ZCIS pricing against the YoY curve via the convexity adjustment — discrepancies indicate model error
- Verify that option pricing recovers observed market cap/floor quotes within bid/offer tolerance
- Ensure deflation floor treatment is correctly specified (floored at 0% for each period vs. floored at maturity only)
- Confirm CSA terms and eligible collateral align with counterparty documentation
- Review index cessation fallback language against current ISDA protocols [VERIFY latest ISDA inflation index cessation provisions]
- Validate that all fixing dates fall on valid publication dates for the chosen index
