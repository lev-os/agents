# Analyzing Insider Buying Signals

## When To Use

- Screening for management conviction signals ahead of catalyst events (earnings, restructurings, activist campaigns)
- Evaluating whether insider open-market purchases indicate asymmetric upside vs. routine compliance-window buying
- Building or validating an event-driven thesis where insider activity is a supporting data point
- Monitoring cluster buying patterns across multiple insiders at the same issuer within a compressed timeframe

## Inputs To Gather

- **SEC Form 4 filings** for the target issuer (all reporting persons, at least trailing 12 months; 24 months preferred)
- **Insider identity and role**: CEO, CFO, directors, 10%+ beneficial owners — role materially affects signal weight
- **Transaction details**: open-market purchases vs. option exercises, gift transactions, or 10b5-1 plan activity (filter out non-discretionary transactions)
- **Purchase size**: absolute dollar amount and percentage of insider's existing holdings (conviction proxy)
- **Company context**: market cap, recent price performance, upcoming catalysts, and current valuation multiples
- **Historical insider accuracy**: prior insider purchases at this issuer and subsequent 6/12-month returns
- **Peer/sector insider activity**: whether cluster buying is isolated or part of a broader sector pattern

## Workflow

1. **Pull and clean Form 4 data** — Extract all Section 16 filings for the target. Exclude derivative exercises, gifts, and automatic 10b5-1 plan transactions. Retain only discretionary open-market purchases and, separately, flag any open-market sales by the same insiders.

2. **Classify each transaction**
   - **Role weight**: C-suite and operating executives > independent directors > 10%+ holders (unless activist)
   - **Size weight**: purchases exceeding 10% of the insider's prior holdings or >$500K absolute are high-conviction [VERIFY — adjust thresholds for micro-cap vs. large-cap]
   - **Timing context**: purchases within 30 days post-earnings release, during open windows, or shortly after price dislocations carry different interpretive weight

3. **Identify cluster buying** — Flag instances where 3+ insiders purchase within a 30-day window. Cluster buying is the single strongest insider signal. Note any contradictory signals (e.g., one insider selling while others buy).

4. **Score conviction** — Assign a composite conviction score (1–5 scale):
   - **5 — Exceptional**: CEO/CFO + multiple directors cluster buying at sizes >20% of prior holdings, no offsetting sales, near 52-week lows
   - **4 — Strong**: Multiple C-suite purchases, meaningful dollar amounts, favorable timing
   - **3 — Moderate**: Single senior insider purchase of material size, or director cluster buying
   - **2 — Weak**: Small purchases, single director, or purchases during routine compliance windows with no unusual context
   - **1 — Noise**: Minimal dollar amounts, recent option exercises creating apparent "buys," or 10b5-1 plan artifacts

5. **Backtest insider track record** — Review prior insider purchases at this issuer over the past 3–5 years. Calculate hit rate (% of purchases followed by positive 6-month and 12-month excess returns vs. sector). Flag if insiders have a history of poorly timed purchases.

6. **Contextualize against thesis** — Map the insider signal against the broader investment thesis. Determine whether the buying confirms, contradicts, or is orthogonal to your catalyst thesis. Insider buying is a supporting factor, not a standalone thesis.

7. **Compile output report** — Structure findings per the Output section below.

## Output

Structure the analysis report with these sections:

- **Executive Summary**: One-paragraph signal assessment with conviction score and key takeaway
- **Transaction Detail Table**: Date, insider name, role, shares purchased, price, dollar amount, % of prior holdings, transaction type
- **Cluster Buying Analysis**: Timeline visualization of purchases, identification of clusters, offsetting sales
- **Conviction Score Breakdown**: Score with rationale for each sub-factor (role, size, timing, cluster, track record)
- **Historical Accuracy**: Table of prior insider purchases and subsequent returns at 3/6/12-month intervals
- **Contextual Factors**: Catalysts, valuation, sector activity, any contradictory signals
- **Limitations and Caveats**: Data gaps, assumptions made, factors that could reduce signal reliability

## Quality Checks

- Confirm all transactions are sourced from actual Form 4 filings, not aggregated third-party summaries that may omit transaction codes [VERIFY]
- Verify that 10b5-1 plan transactions have been correctly excluded — check for footnotes in Form 4 indicating pre-planned trades
- Ensure conviction scoring is consistent: same criteria applied across all insiders and time periods
- Cross-check for contemporaneous insider sales that would undercut the bullish signal
- Validate that historical return calculations use appropriate benchmarks (sector index, not just S&P 500)
- Flag any insiders subject to pending SEC enforcement actions or restatement risk, which would contaminate the signal
- Note that insider buying data has inherent reporting lags (Form 4 due within 2 business days but late filings are common) [VERIFY]
