# Managing Lease Accounting

Structures ASC 842 lease analysis with classification, measurement, and disclosure requirements for right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.

## When To Use

- Onboarding new leases (real estate, equipment, vehicles) into the ASC 842 framework
- Reclassifying leases after contract modifications, renewals, or remeasurement events
- Calculating or recalculating ROU assets and lease liabilities at commencement or upon reassessment
- Preparing lease-related disclosures for quarterly (10-Q) or annual (10-K) financial statements
- Evaluating whether embedded leases exist within service or supply contracts
- Coordinating lease data between treasury, real estate, and financial reporting teams

## Inputs To Gather

- **Lease contracts and amendments** — full executed agreements including all riders, addenda, and modification letters
- **Lease population schedule** — master list of all active leases with commencement dates, expiration dates, and renewal/termination options
- **Payment schedules** — base rent, escalation clauses, variable payments (CAM, insurance, taxes), residual value guarantees, and purchase options
- **Discount rate data** — incremental borrowing rate (IBR) by entity and currency, or rate implicit in the lease if determinable
- **Lease classification inputs** — fair value of underlying asset, useful life, present value of payments relative to fair value threshold [VERIFY: company policy on bright-line thresholds vs. qualitative assessment]
- **Prior-period ROU and liability balances** — for modifications, impairments, or remeasurement triggers
- **Short-term and low-value election decisions** — documented policy elections under ASC 842-20-25-2

## Workflow

1. **Scope the lease population**
   - Confirm all contracts meeting the ASC 842 definition of a lease (identified asset + right to control use) are captured
   - Screen service agreements and supply contracts for embedded lease components using the three-criterion test (identified asset, substantially all economic benefits, right to direct use)
   - Document any practical expedient elections (e.g., combining lease and non-lease components for specific asset classes)

2. **Classify each lease**
   - Apply the five classification criteria under ASC 842-10-25-2: transfer of ownership, purchase option reasonably certain, lease term as major part of useful life, present value as substantially all of fair value, specialized nature of asset
   - Designate as **finance lease** if any criterion is met; otherwise classify as **operating lease**
   - For modifications, determine whether the change is a separate lease or a remeasurement of the existing lease [VERIFY: company's materiality thresholds for reclassification triggers]

3. **Measure ROU asset and lease liability**
   - Calculate lease liability as the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted at the IBR (or implicit rate if available)
   - Determine ROU asset as lease liability + initial direct costs + prepaid payments − lease incentives received
   - For finance leases, set up amortization of the ROU asset (typically straight-line) and interest expense on the liability (effective interest method)
   - For operating leases, calculate single straight-line lease expense; back into amortization of ROU asset as the plug (total expense minus interest on liability)

4. **Handle modifications and reassessments**
   - On modification: remeasure liability using revised payments and a revised discount rate; adjust ROU asset by the same amount (unless partial termination triggers a proportional reduction and gain/loss)
   - Reassess lease term and purchase options when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs
   - Impairment test ROU assets under ASC 360 when indicators are present (e.g., sublease at a loss, store closure)

5. **Prepare disclosures**
   - Quantitative: finance lease cost (amortization + interest), operating lease cost, short-term lease cost, variable lease cost, sublease income
   - Maturity analysis: undiscounted future payments by year for the next five years plus a thereafter bucket, reconciled to the balance sheet liability
   - Weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate, split by finance and operating leases
   - Cash flow presentation: operating leases in operating activities; finance lease principal in financing activities, interest per company policy [VERIFY: classification of finance lease interest — operating vs. financing per ASC 842-30-45]

## Output

- **Lease classification summary** — table listing each lease, classification rationale, and key measurement inputs
- **ROU asset and lease liability roll-forward** — beginning balance, additions, modifications, amortization/accretion, impairments, terminations, ending balance
- **Journal entry schedules** — month-by-month entries for new leases, modifications, and recurring amortization/interest
- **Disclosure-ready tables** — maturity schedule, cost breakdowns, and weighted-average metrics formatted for footnote insertion
- **Exception log** — items requiring further review (e.g., missing IBR support, unsigned amendments, ambiguous renewal terms)

## Quality Checks

- Verify that total lease expense on the income statement ties to the ROU asset and lease liability movements on the balance sheet
- Confirm the maturity analysis undiscounted total, when discounted, reconciles to the reported lease liability (within rounding tolerance)
- Cross-check the lease population schedule against accounts payable rent accruals and cash disbursement records to catch unrecorded leases
- Validate that IBR assumptions are documented with market data support and are consistent across leases with similar risk profiles and tenors
- Ensure short-term and low-value elections are applied consistently and disclosed as required
- Flag any lease with a remaining term under 12 months that was not elected as short-term — confirm intentional treatment [VERIFY: whether entity has elected the short-term lease exemption by asset class]
