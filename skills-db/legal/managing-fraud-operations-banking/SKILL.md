# Managing Fraud Operations Banking

## When To Use

- Structuring or reviewing a bank's fraud detection and investigation program across deposit, lending, or trade finance channels
- Building or updating transaction monitoring rule sets and alert-triage workflows
- Documenting a fraud case from initial alert through investigation, loss quantification, and recovery action
- Preparing fraud operations status reports for management, audit committees, or regulators
- Coordinating cross-functional response (operations, compliance, legal, law enforcement) on active fraud matters

## Inputs To Gather

- **Transaction data scope**: Channels monitored (wire, ACH, check, card, trade finance instruments), volume baselines, and monitoring platform(s) in use
- **Alert and case inventory**: Current alert queue depth, open case count, aging distribution, and backlog status
- **Rule/model inventory**: Active detection rules or models, last tuning date, false-positive rates, and known coverage gaps
- **Loss and recovery data**: Confirmed fraud losses (gross and net of recoveries), recovery pipeline, and insurance or indemnification positions
- **Regulatory context**: Applicable SAR filing obligations, consent orders or MRAs related to fraud operations, and upcoming exam dates [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific SAR thresholds and filing timelines]
- **Staffing and SLAs**: Investigator headcount, case-per-analyst ratios, and target SLAs for alert disposition and case closure
- **Escalation history**: Recent escalations to BSA officer, legal counsel, or law enforcement, and any pending subpoenas or information requests

## Workflow

1. **Map the detection landscape**
   - Inventory all monitoring rules/models by fraud typology (account takeover, check fraud, wire fraud, trade-based money laundering, loan fraud, synthetic identity)
   - Document detection coverage per channel and product line; flag unmonitored gaps
   - Record current alert volumes, true-positive rates, and average time-to-disposition

2. **Triage and prioritize alerts**
   - Classify alerts by risk tier (dollar amount, customer risk rating, typology severity)
   - Apply disposition decision tree: close as false positive, escalate to case, or refer for enhanced due diligence
   - Document triage rationale for audit trail — every closed alert needs a recorded basis

3. **Investigate confirmed cases**
   - Assemble case file: triggering alert(s), customer profile, transaction timeline, supporting documents (statements, images, communications)
   - Identify fraud typology, method of execution, and whether the fraud is internal, external, or collusive
   - Quantify exposure: gross loss, funds held/frozen, recoverable amounts, and insurance applicability
   - Determine SAR filing obligation and timeline [VERIFY — SAR must generally be filed within 30 days of detection, with 60-day extension if suspect not identified; confirm per FinCEN or local regulator guidance]

4. **Execute recovery and containment**
   - Initiate hold/freeze actions on affected accounts per the bank's authority and applicable regulation [VERIFY hold/freeze authority under Reg CC, UCC 4A, or local equivalent]
   - Send indemnity or recall requests for outgoing wires/ACH; track response deadlines
   - Coordinate with law enforcement: prepare criminal referral packages, respond to subpoenas, preserve evidence chain of custody
   - For trade finance fraud, issue stop-payment on letters of credit or demand return of documents from advising/confirming banks

5. **Report and optimize**
   - Compile fraud operations dashboard: alert volumes and disposition rates, open/closed cases, loss trends, recovery rates, SAR filing counts, and SLA adherence
   - Identify top loss drivers and recommend rule tuning, new detection scenarios, or control enhancements
   - Track regulatory commitments (MRA remediation, consent order milestones) and report status
   - Document lessons learned from significant cases for inclusion in training and rule refinement

## Output

The deliverable is a **Fraud Operations Management Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Period-over-period fraud loss trends, key case highlights, and strategic risk observations
- **Detection performance metrics**: Alert volumes by typology, false-positive rates, detection-to-case conversion rates, and rule coverage matrix
- **Case management summary**: Open/closed case counts, aging analysis, loss and recovery figures, and SAR filing statistics
- **Recovery tracker**: Pending recalls, indemnity claims, frozen funds status, insurance claims, and projected net loss
- **Action items and recommendations**: Rule tuning proposals, staffing adjustments, control gap remediation, and regulatory commitment status
- **Escalation log**: Items requiring senior management, legal, or board-level attention

## Quality Checks

- All loss figures reconcile to the general ledger fraud loss accounts and any sub-ledger recovery tracking
- SAR filing counts and timelines are cross-referenced against the case management system — no filing gaps
- Alert disposition rates account for 100% of generated alerts (no unresolved or orphaned alerts in the queue)
- Detection coverage matrix explicitly identifies any product, channel, or typology without an active rule or model
- Recovery amounts distinguish between funds actually returned and funds with pending claims — no commingling of confirmed and projected recoveries
- Report does not disclose SAR filing status to subjects of investigation or unauthorized parties [VERIFY — SAR confidentiality requirements under 31 USC § 5318(g)(2)]
- Staffing and SLA metrics are benchmarked against prior period and, where available, peer institution data
