# Managing Intercompany Transactions

Structures intercompany pricing with transfer pricing documentation and arm's-length analysis.

## When To Use

- Setting or revising transfer prices for goods, services, IP licenses, or management fees between related entities
- Preparing or updating transfer pricing documentation (master file, local file, or country-by-country report)
- Evaluating whether existing intercompany arrangements satisfy arm's-length standards
- Onboarding a new subsidiary or business unit into the group's intercompany framework
- Responding to a tax authority inquiry or audit on related-party transactions
- Performing periodic benchmarking studies to refresh comparable data

## Inputs To Gather

- **Entity structure**: Legal org chart showing all transacting entities, jurisdictions, and functional relationships
- **Transaction catalog**: List of all intercompany flows — product sales, service charges, royalties, cost-sharing payments, financing, guarantees
- **Functional analysis data**: Functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed by each entity in each transaction type
- **Financial data**: Segmented P&L for each entity, including intercompany revenue/cost line items and margins
- **Existing TP documentation**: Prior master file, local files, benchmarking studies, advance pricing agreements (APAs), or rulings
- **Comparable data sources**: Access to commercial databases (e.g., Bureau van Dijk, S&P Capital IQ) or internal comparable sets
- **Regulatory requirements**: Applicable TP rules per jurisdiction — documentation thresholds, filing deadlines, penalty regimes [VERIFY]

## Workflow

1. **Map the intercompany landscape**
   - Chart every related-party transaction by type (tangible goods, services, intangibles, financial)
   - Identify the tested party for each transaction (typically the less complex entity)
   - Note transaction volumes, currencies, and frequency

2. **Conduct functional analysis**
   - For each transaction, document functions (manufacturing, R&D, distribution, marketing), assets (IP, inventory, fixed assets), and risks (market, credit, inventory obsolescence)
   - Classify each entity's profile: full-fledged manufacturer, contract manufacturer, limited-risk distributor, commissionaire, etc.
   - Flag any changes in functional profiles year-over-year that could shift pricing

3. **Select transfer pricing method**
   - Evaluate the five OECD methods: CUP, Resale Price, Cost Plus, TNMM/CPM, Profit Split
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on comparability and data availability
   - Document the reason for rejecting alternative methods
   - [VERIFY] Confirm the selected method is accepted under each relevant jurisdiction's TP regulations

4. **Perform benchmarking and arm's-length analysis**
   - Define search criteria: industry codes, geographic filters, independence screens, financial size
   - Run comparable company or comparable transaction searches
   - Apply quantitative screens (e.g., reject companies with negative operating margins in 3+ years, R&D intensity outliers)
   - Calculate interquartile range of the profit-level indicator (operating margin, Berry ratio, net cost plus markup, etc.)
   - Compare the tested party's actual results against the arm's-length range

5. **Set or adjust intercompany prices**
   - If results fall within the interquartile range, document as compliant
   - If outside the range, recommend price adjustments — prospective policy changes or year-end true-ups
   - For new transactions, establish pricing policies with formulas or rate cards tied to benchmarked ranges
   - Address any compensating adjustments needed across jurisdictions

6. **Prepare transfer pricing documentation**
   - **Master file**: Group overview, intangible ownership, financial activities, consolidated positions
   - **Local file**: Entity-specific functional analysis, transaction details, method selection, benchmarking results, financial data
   - **Country-by-country report (CbCR)**: Revenue, profit, tax paid, employees, and tangible assets by jurisdiction [VERIFY filing thresholds per jurisdiction]
   - Ensure documentation is contemporaneous — prepared or updated before the filing deadline

7. **Implement controls and monitoring**
   - Set intercompany pricing policies in ERP/billing systems to enforce approved rates
   - Schedule quarterly or semi-annual margin reviews against the benchmarked range
   - Establish escalation triggers: margin deviation > 2 percentage points, new transaction types, entity restructurings
   - Track APA renewals, MAP cases, or pending audits

## Output

- **Intercompany transaction matrix**: Entity-pair grid showing transaction types, volumes, methods, and tested-party margins
- **Functional analysis summary**: Per-entity profile with FAR (functions, assets, risks) classification
- **Benchmarking study**: Search strategy, rejection log, final comparable set, interquartile range, and conclusion
- **Transfer pricing policy memo**: Approved pricing formulas, true-up mechanisms, and governance procedures
- **Documentation package**: Master file, local file(s), and CbCR-ready data, formatted per OECD/local requirements
- **Exception report**: Transactions outside the arm's-length range with recommended corrective actions

## Quality Checks

- Every intercompany transaction is mapped and has an assigned TP method — no unaddressed flows
- Functional analysis reflects current-year operations, not stale descriptions carried forward
- Benchmarking comparables are screened for independence (no related-party revenue above threshold, typically 25%)
- Interquartile range is calculated using multi-year weighted averages where required [VERIFY per jurisdiction]
- Documentation references the correct fiscal year's financial data, not prior-period figures
- Pricing policies are implementable in the group's ERP and accounting systems
- All jurisdiction-specific thresholds, penalties, and safe harbors are flagged with [VERIFY] for local counsel or tax advisor confirmation
- Double taxation risk is identified where adjustments in one jurisdiction are not automatically recognized in the counterpart jurisdiction
