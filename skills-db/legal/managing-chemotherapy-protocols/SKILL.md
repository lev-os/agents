# Managing Chemotherapy Protocols

Verifies chemotherapy orders against regimen protocols with dose calculations, cycle timing, cumulative toxicity tracking, and supportive care requirements.

## Why This Skill Exists

Chemotherapy agents are among the highest-risk medications in healthcare. ISMP classifies all antineoplastic agents as high-alert medications. Dosing errors in chemotherapy can be rapidly fatal—historical events such as the overdose deaths resulting from miscalculated methotrexate and vincristine doses underscore the zero-tolerance requirement for accuracy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) jointly published chemotherapy administration safety standards that require independent double-verification of every chemotherapy order.

Pharmacist verification of chemotherapy encompasses: confirming regimen appropriateness per NCCN guidelines, calculating body surface area (BSA) and weight-based doses, applying dose reductions for organ impairment and cumulative toxicity, verifying cycle day and treatment schedule, confirming pre-medications and supportive care, and reviewing lab clearance parameters. Errors at any of these steps can result in treatment failure (underdosing), life-threatening toxicity (overdosing), or wrong-regimen administration. Oncology pharmacy is recognized as a board-certified specialty (BCOP) due to the complexity and risk involved.

## Checkpoint A: Pre-Draft Intake (Mandatory)

1. What is the cancer diagnosis with stage and histology? (Default: request oncology documentation)
2. What regimen is ordered (by standard name, e.g., FOLFOX, R-CHOP, AC-T)? (Default: verify against NCCN)
3. What cycle number and day of treatment is this? (Default: verify from treatment calendar)
4. What are the patient's current height, weight, and BSA? (Default: calculate BSA)
5. Is there a dose cap applied (e.g., BSA capped at 2.0 m² per institutional policy)? (Default: check policy)
6. What are the most recent lab values (CBC with differential, CMP, LFTs, creatinine)? (Default: request within 48h)
7. Has cumulative dose tracking been performed for cardiotoxic or nephrotoxic agents? (Default: pull from oncology record)
8. What supportive care and pre-medications are ordered? (Default: verify against regimen protocol)

### Documents to Request

- NCCN guideline for the specific cancer type and regimen
- Treatment protocol or order set from the institutional formulary
- Prior treatment cycles with doses administered and toxicity grading
- Current labs: CBC with differential (ANC), BMP, LFTs (AST, ALT, bilirubin), SCr/CrCl
- Current height and weight (measured, not reported)
- Echocardiogram or MUGA scan results (for anthracycline-containing regimens)
- Allergy and prior infusion reaction history
- Performance status (ECOG or Karnofsky)

## Step 1: Regimen Verification and BSA Calculation

**BSA calculation (Mosteller formula):**
BSA (m²) = √[(height(cm) × weight(kg)) / 3600]

**Alternative (DuBois):**
BSA (m²) = 0.007184 × height(cm)^0.725 × weight(kg)^0.425

**Weight considerations:**
- Use actual body weight for BSA unless institutional policy caps BSA (commonly at 2.0 m²)
- ASCO guidelines recommend using actual body weight for obese patients for curative-intent regimens
- Round BSA to two decimal places

**Verify regimen components against NCCN or primary literature:**
- Correct drugs for the regimen
- Correct doses per m² or per kg
- Correct cycle length (14-day, 21-day, 28-day)
- Correct day of administration within the cycle
- Correct route (IV, intrathecal, oral) for each agent

## Step 2: Dose Calculation and Modification

Calculate each agent's dose and verify against protocol limits:

**Common dose modification triggers:**

| Toxicity | Parameter | Typical Modification |
|---|---|---|
| Neutropenia | ANC <1,000/µL (grade 3) | Hold until ANC >1,500; consider 25% dose reduction |
| Thrombocytopenia | Platelets <75,000/µL | Hold until >100,000; consider 25% dose reduction |
| Hepatic impairment | Bilirubin >1.5× ULN | Reduce or hold per drug-specific guidance |
| Renal impairment | CrCl <60 mL/min | Carboplatin by Calvert (AUC × [GFR + 25]); cisplatin: avoid if CrCl <50 |
| Neuropathy | Grade 2+ peripheral neuropathy | Reduce or discontinue vincristine, oxaliplatin, taxanes |
| Cardiotoxicity | LVEF <50% or >10% decline | Hold anthracyclines; reassess benefit-risk |
| Mucositis | Grade 3-4 | Reduce fluoropyrimidines 25-50% |

**Cumulative dose limits (must track across all cycles):**

| Agent | Cumulative Limit | Toxicity |
|---|---|---|
| Doxorubicin | 450-550 mg/m² lifetime | Cardiomyopathy |
| Epirubicin | 900 mg/m² lifetime | Cardiomyopathy |
| Bleomycin | 400 units lifetime | Pulmonary fibrosis |
| Cisplatin | Monitor cumulative; no absolute cap | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity |
| Vincristine | 2 mg single-dose cap | Neurotoxicity |

---

## Step 3: Supportive Care and Pre-Medication Verification

Verify the following supportive care elements are ordered:

**Antiemetic regimen (per ASCO/NCCN emetogenicity classification):**

| Emetogenic Risk | Pre-Medications |
|---|---|
| High (>90%: cisplatin, AC) | NK1 antagonist + 5-HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone ± olanzapine |
| Moderate (30-90%: carboplatin, oxaliplatin) | 5-HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone ± NK1 antagonist |
| Low (10-30%: etoposide, taxanes) | Dexamethasone or 5-HT3 antagonist |
| Minimal (<10%: vincristine, bleomycin) | As needed only |

**Additional supportive care:**
- Growth factor support (G-CSF/pegfilgrastim) if regimen has >20% febrile neutropenia risk
- Tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis (allopurinol or rasburicase) for high-burden hematologic malignancies
- Hydration protocol for cisplatin (≥1 L NS pre and post with mannitol diuresis)
- Leucovorin rescue timing for high-dose methotrexate
- Mesna for ifosfamide or high-dose cyclophosphamide (hemorrhagic cystitis prevention)
- Dexrazoxane for doxorubicin cumulative doses approaching limit

## Step 4: Safety Verification and Independent Double-Check

Before chemotherapy is released for administration, complete:

1. **Two-pharmacist verification:** Independent dose calculation by a second oncology pharmacist
2. **Regimen-order match:** Every drug, dose, route, rate, and diluent matches the approved protocol
3. **Lab clearance:** ANC, platelets, renal function, hepatic function within treatment parameters
4. **Allergy check:** No known allergies to any regimen component or diluent
5. **Cumulative dose check:** Lifetime cumulative doses within limits
6. **Extravasation risk classification:** Vesicant (doxorubicin, vincristine), irritant (carboplatin), or non-vesicant
7. **Administration precautions:** Central line required for vesicants, infusion rate limits, light-protection

## Checkpoint B: Post-Draft Alignment (Mandatory)

1. Does the regimen match the NCCN-recommended protocol for the diagnosis and stage?
2. Was BSA calculated from measured height and weight, not historical values?
3. Are all dose modifications applied based on current lab values and prior cycle toxicity?
4. Is the cumulative lifetime dose tracked for cardiotoxic and pulmonary-toxic agents?
5. Are antiemetics, growth factors, and other supportive care matched to emetogenicity and febrile neutropenia risk?

## Guidelines

- NEVER deviate from an established regimen protocol without oncologist discussion and documentation
- Vincristine must NEVER be placed in a syringe; dispense only in a minibag to prevent fatal intrathecal administration
- Always use measured (not historical) height and weight for BSA calculation
- Carboplatin dosing by Calvert formula requires an accurate GFR; cap GFR at 125 mL/min per FDA guidance to prevent overdosing
- Track cumulative anthracycline doses in a patient-specific log that persists across treatment episodes
- Two independent pharmacist verifications are required before chemotherapy leaves the pharmacy
- Chemotherapy must be prepared in a biological safety cabinet (BSC) or compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI)
- All chemotherapy spills must be managed with spill kits following OSHA and NIOSH guidelines
