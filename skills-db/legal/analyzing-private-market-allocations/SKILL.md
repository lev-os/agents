# Analyzing Private Market Allocations

## When To Use

- Establishing or revising a target allocation to private equity, private credit, real assets, or venture capital
- Modeling commitment pacing to reach and maintain a desired NAV exposure over a multi-year horizon
- Projecting J-curve effects on portfolio returns during the early years of a private markets program
- Evaluating liquidity requirements against expected capital calls and distributions
- Stress-testing an illiquid allocation under different macro or fundraising scenarios
- Advising wealth management clients on appropriate private market exposure given their liquidity profile

## Inputs To Gather

- **Total portfolio AUM** and current private market NAV as a percentage of total
- **Target allocation** to private markets (overall and by sub-strategy: buyout, growth, VC, private credit, real estate, infrastructure, secondaries)
- **Existing fund commitments**: vintage year, unfunded commitments, current NAV, expected remaining life
- **Commitment pacing assumptions**: planned annual commitment amounts or ranges over the next 3–10 years
- **Cash flow model parameters**: draw-down rate curve (typical: 20-30% Year 1, 15-25% Year 2, declining thereafter), distribution assumptions by strategy, recycling provisions
- **Liquidity constraints**: minimum liquid asset threshold, upcoming known cash needs, redemption terms on semi-liquid vehicles
- **Return assumptions**: target net IRR and net MOIC by sub-strategy, public market equivalent (PME) benchmark
- **Fee structure**: management fee rates, carried interest terms, fund-of-funds or co-invest overlay fees if applicable
- **Investor type and regulatory context** [VERIFY]: ERISA plan benefit percentage limits, insurance company basket clause limits, endowment/foundation spending rate requirements

## Workflow

1. **Baseline the current portfolio** — Map existing fund commitments by vintage, strategy, and GP. Calculate current NAV exposure, total unfunded commitments, and the over-commitment ratio (total commitments / target NAV allocation). Flag any vintage year or strategy concentrations.

2. **Set target allocation and sub-strategy mix** — Define the desired steady-state private market allocation as a percentage of projected AUM. Break it into sub-strategy buckets (e.g., 40% buyout, 20% growth equity, 15% private credit, 15% real assets, 10% secondaries/co-invest). Confirm alignment with the investment policy statement or client mandate.

3. **Build the commitment pacing model** — Project annual new commitments needed to reach and sustain the target allocation. Account for:
   - Natural NAV decay as older funds liquidate
   - Expected net cash flows (calls minus distributions) each year
   - AUM growth or contraction scenarios
   - Over-commitment ratio management (typical ranges: 1.3x–1.8x for mature programs, higher for ramp-up phases)

4. **Model J-curve and cash flow dynamics** — For each vintage year tranche, project the capital call schedule and distribution waterfall. Aggregate across all vintages to produce a consolidated annual cash flow forecast. Identify the J-curve trough (typically years 2–4 of a new program) and the crossover point where cumulative distributions exceed cumulative contributions.

5. **Run liquidity stress tests** — Test scenarios where:
   - Capital calls accelerate (e.g., GPs deploy faster than modeled)
   - Distributions slow (e.g., exit markets freeze for 12–18 months)
   - Public market drawdown increases the denominator effect, pushing private market NAV above target
   - Simultaneous call acceleration and distribution drought (worst case)
   - Confirm the portfolio maintains minimum liquidity thresholds under each scenario

6. **Evaluate return and risk contribution** — Estimate the portfolio-level impact of the private allocation on expected return, volatility (using smoothed and unsmoothed NAV returns), and Sharpe ratio. Calculate the expected PME relative to the relevant public index. Note the impact of fees on net-of-fee return expectations.

7. **Assess implementation vehicles** — Determine the mix of primary fund commitments, secondary purchases, co-investments, and semi-liquid vehicles (e.g., evergreen funds, interval funds). Secondaries and co-invest can mitigate the J-curve; semi-liquid vehicles provide partial redemption optionality but typically at lower net returns.

8. **Compile findings and recommendations** — Summarize target allocation, pacing schedule, projected cash flows, liquidity analysis, and risk/return expectations into a structured report.

## Output

The deliverable should include:

- **Executive summary**: Target allocation, key pacing parameters, and primary risk factors
- **Current state snapshot**: Table of existing commitments by vintage, strategy, GP, unfunded amount, and current NAV
- **Commitment pacing schedule**: Year-by-year planned commitments for the next 5–10 years with NAV path projection
- **Cash flow projections**: Annual capital calls, distributions, and net cash flow; cumulative J-curve chart
- **Liquidity analysis**: Minimum liquid asset ratio under base and stress scenarios; flagged breach points
- **Sub-strategy allocation table**: Target vs. current exposure by strategy with rebalancing recommendations
- **Return projections**: Expected net IRR, net MOIC, and PME by sub-strategy and blended portfolio level
- **Implementation notes**: Recommended vehicle mix, GP pipeline considerations, and timing of next commitments

## Quality Checks

- Confirm the over-commitment ratio stays within policy limits across all projection years
- Verify that the sum of sub-strategy targets equals the total private market target allocation
- Ensure cash flow projections use draw-down and distribution curves appropriate to each strategy (e.g., buyout draws faster than VC; real estate distributes earlier than growth equity)
- Check that denominator-effect scenarios are modeled (public market declines inflating private allocation percentage)
- Validate that fee assumptions reflect actual fund terms, not generic placeholders
- Confirm liquidity stress tests include at least one combined adverse scenario (simultaneous call acceleration + distribution delay + public market drawdown)
- [VERIFY] Regulatory allocation limits: ERISA 25% benefit plan asset threshold, state insurance investment basket clause percentages, any client-specific IPS constraints
- [VERIFY] Tax treatment differences across vehicle types (LP interests, co-invest SPVs, blocker structures for tax-exempt investors)
- Flag any GP concentration risk where commitments to a single manager exceed a prudent threshold (typically 10–15% of the private allocation)
