# Managing Clinical Registries

Structures clinical registry data collection, quality measure calculation, and regulatory reporting for both internal disease registries and external Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs). This skill covers registry design, data acquisition, measure computation, and submission workflows for CMS quality programs.

## Why This Skill Exists

Clinical registries serve two functions: internal quality improvement (tracking outcomes for specific patient populations) and external quality reporting (MIPS QCDR submission, specialty society registries like STS, NCDR, NSQIP). Poor registry management leads to inaccurate quality scores, CMS payment adjustments (up to -9% under MIPS), missed public reporting deadlines, and invalid benchmarking data. Registries require disciplined data collection, standardized measure calculation, and rigorous submission validation to serve their intended purpose.


The regulatory landscape for clinical registries is expanding. CMS increasingly ties quality program participation to registry submission, specialty boards use registry data for maintenance of certification, and payers reference registry outcomes in value-based contracts. A poorly managed registry produces data that misrepresents clinical performance, undermines public reporting accuracy, and fails to support genuine quality improvement.

## Checkpoint A --- Intake & Scoping

Answer every question before proceeding. Mark unknowns with [VERIFY].

1. **Registry type** --- Internal quality registry, external specialty registry (STS, NCDR, ACS NSQIP, AAOS AJRR), or QCDR for MIPS reporting?
2. **Clinical domain** --- Which patient population and condition? (Cardiac surgery, joint replacement, stroke, diabetes, cancer)
3. **Measures** --- Which quality measures are calculated? (CMS eCQMs, QCDR measures, specialty-specific outcome measures)
4. **Data collection method** --- Automated extraction from EHR, manual chart abstraction, hybrid?
5. **Reporting obligations** --- What are the submission deadlines? (MIPS: March 31 for prior performance year; specialty registries have variable deadlines)
6. **Case identification** --- How are eligible patients identified? (Procedure codes, diagnosis codes, encounter types, referral to a specific service)
7. **Current data quality** --- What is the known data completeness rate for the registry? What are the primary abstraction challenges?

### Required Documents

- Registry data dictionary with field definitions, valid values, and required/optional classification
- Quality measure specifications (numerator, denominator, exclusions, exceptions)
- Case identification algorithm (ICD-10-CM/PCS, CPT codes defining eligible encounters)
- Data collection form or abstraction tool template
- Submission file format specification (XML schema, CSV layout, API specification)
- Previous submission validation reports and error logs

8. **Registry technology platform** --- What software manages the registry? (Vendor registry platform, EHR-embedded module, custom database, cloud-hosted SaaS)
9. **Multi-site participation** --- Is this a single-site or multi-site registry? If multi-site, how is data aggregated and benchmarked?

### Common Registry Reference

## Step 1 --- Design Case Identification

Build a reliable case-finding algorithm:

- **Code-based identification** --- Define the procedure and/or diagnosis codes that qualify a patient for registry inclusion. For surgical registries, use CPT codes (e.g., CABG: 33510-33536). For disease registries, use ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes with confirmation logic (2+ encounters or diagnosis + disease-specific treatment)
- **Encounter type filtering** --- Restrict to clinically appropriate encounter types: inpatient for surgical registries, ambulatory for chronic disease registries, ED for trauma registries
- **Temporal boundaries** --- Define the reporting period and any look-back windows required for historical data (e.g., prior comorbidities within 12 months of index procedure)
- **Automated identification** --- Build EHR-based case identification queries that run daily or weekly. Flag newly eligible patients for abstraction within 48 hours of the qualifying event
- **Case completeness audit** --- Monthly comparison of automated case identification against manual chart review on a random sample. Target sensitivity >= 95% (miss rate < 5%)

---

## Step 2 --- Structure Data Collection

Implement reliable data acquisition:

- **Automated extraction mapping** --- Map EHR structured data fields to registry data elements: demographics (from PID/ADT), diagnoses (from problem list using SNOMED CT, mapped to ICD-10-CM), procedures (from surgical case log), lab results (from LOINC-coded observations), medications (from RxNorm-coded medication list)
- **Manual abstraction protocol** --- For data elements not available in structured form (e.g., surgical technique details, functional status assessments, patient-reported outcomes), define abstraction rules with explicit source hierarchy: operative note > discharge summary > progress notes
- **Data element validation rules** --- Apply real-time validation during collection: range checks (ejection fraction 5-80%), consistency checks (discharge date >= admission date), conditional logic (if procedure type = CABG, then number of grafts is required)
- **Abstractor training** --- Initial certification requiring 90%+ accuracy on test cases plus annual recertification. Double abstraction on 5% of cases for ongoing inter-rater reliability monitoring
- **Timeliness targets** --- Define abstraction completion deadlines relative to the qualifying event: 30 days post-discharge for surgical registries, concurrent for real-time quality dashboards

- **Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)** --- For registries requiring PROMs (AAOS AJRR, oncology registries), implement electronic collection: pre-visit surveys via patient portal, validated instruments (PROMIS, VR-12, PHQ-9), collection timing aligned with registry specifications, and automated scoring with EHR integration
---

## Step 3 --- Calculate Quality Measures

Compute measures according to specifications:

- **Denominator construction** --- Apply the measure's denominator criteria to the registry population. Denominator = all eligible patients minus denominator exclusions (e.g., patients with documented contraindications)
- **Numerator evaluation** --- For each denominator patient, determine if the numerator criteria are met. Use coded data with exact value set matching from VSAC or the measure specification
- **Exclusion and exception processing** --- Apply valid exclusions (clinical contraindication documented in structured data) and exceptions (patient refusal, medical reason documented). Ensure exception codes are captured in structured fields, not buried in free text
- **Risk adjustment** --- For outcome measures (mortality, readmission, complication rates), apply the specified risk adjustment model. Document the model version, covariates, and coefficient source. Never compare unadjusted outcome rates across providers
- **Composite scoring** --- For registries that produce composite quality scores (e.g., CMS star ratings), apply the specified weighting methodology across individual measures

- **Benchmark interpretation** --- When comparing organizational performance against registry benchmarks, account for: case mix differences, data completeness differences, volume effects (low-volume providers have wider confidence intervals), and secular trends (national performance may be improving, making a stable rate look relatively worse)
---

## Step 4 --- Validate Before Submission

Pre-submission validation prevents rejection and audit findings:

- **Schema validation** --- Validate the submission file against the registry's XML schema or data format specification. Reject files with structural errors before content review
- **Business rule validation** --- Apply the registry's business rules: required field completeness, cross-field consistency, valid code verification against the registry's code tables
- **Outlier detection** --- Flag statistically unusual values: 0% or 100% measure performance rates (likely data errors), case volumes significantly different from prior periods, complication rates outside expected ranges
- **Year-over-year comparison** --- Compare current submission against prior year: case volume within 10%, measure rates within plausible change ranges, demographic distributions stable
- **Sample verification** --- Pull 10-15 randomly selected cases and compare the registry record against the source EHR chart. Confirm accuracy of diagnosis coding, procedure details, outcome documentation, and measure calculations

---

## Step 5 --- Submit and Monitor

Execute the submission and manage the feedback cycle:

- **Submission logistics** --- Submit per the registry's specified method (QRDA III for CMS, proprietary portal for specialty registries, API for automated submission). Confirm receipt acknowledgment
- **Error remediation** --- Address any rejection or warning messages from the registry. Common errors: invalid codes, missing required fields, duplicate records, date inconsistencies
- **Feedback report review** --- When the registry returns performance data, compare against internal calculations. Discrepancies indicate either a calculation error internally or a data interpretation difference at the registry
- **Public reporting preparation** --- For registries with public reporting (CMS Compare, Leapfrog, specialty society reports), review pre-release data during the preview period. Dispute inaccurate data before public release
- **Continuous data submission** --- For registries accepting rolling submissions (not annual batch), establish a monthly submission cadence with ongoing validation

- **Registry audit preparation** --- Maintain audit readiness at all times: source documentation for every abstracted data element, version-controlled abstraction rules, inter-rater reliability records, and correspondence with the registry regarding data questions or corrections

## Guidelines

- Case identification is the foundation: if you miss eligible patients, your quality rates are artificially inflated. Over-identification (capturing ineligible patients) inflates denominators and dilutes performance
- Manual chart abstraction is error-prone and expensive. Maximize EHR-to-registry automated extraction and reserve manual abstraction for data elements that genuinely require clinical interpretation
- Never submit data without sample verification. Registry submissions become the public record of an organization's quality performance and cannot easily be corrected after the fact
- For MIPS QCDR submission, ensure the QCDR is on the CMS-approved list for the reporting year and that the reported measures meet the minimum case threshold (typically 20 cases per measure)
- Treat registry data quality as a clinical quality issue, not an IT issue. Inaccurate registry data misrepresents patient outcomes and can lead to misallocated quality improvement resources
- Risk adjustment is not optional for outcome comparisons. Unadjusted mortality or complication rates reflect case mix, not quality. Never present unadjusted outcomes as performance indicators
- Maintain version control on the case identification algorithm, abstraction rules, and measure calculation logic. Changes between reporting periods must be documented to explain performance trends
- Monitor for "coding creep" --- gradual expansion of diagnosis coding that inflates risk scores without reflecting true clinical complexity. Compare diagnosis capture rates against clinical documentation

- Use registry data for quality improvement, not just reporting. Organizations that submit data but never analyze their performance against benchmarks miss the primary value of registry participation
- For multi-site health systems, standardize registry data collection across sites to enable valid internal benchmarking. Site-level variation in abstraction practices undermines comparability
