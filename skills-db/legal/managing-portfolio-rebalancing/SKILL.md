# Managing Portfolio Rebalancing

Structures rebalancing processes with drift monitoring, tax-aware trading, and transaction cost optimization.

## When To Use

- Portfolio allocations have drifted beyond policy-defined thresholds (absolute or relative)
- Calendar-based rebalancing triggers are approaching (quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
- Cash flows (contributions, withdrawals, distributions) create meaningful allocation shifts
- Market events cause rapid asset class divergence from target weights
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities overlap with rebalancing needs
- New investment policy statement (IPS) targets require transition trading

## Inputs To Gather

- **Current portfolio holdings**: Positions, quantities, market values, cost basis (lot-level if tax-aware)
- **Target allocation**: Policy weights by asset class, sub-asset class, or individual security
- **Drift thresholds**: Absolute (e.g., ±3%) and relative (e.g., ±20% of target weight) tolerance bands
- **Rebalancing constraints**: Minimum trade size, restricted securities, liquidity limits, sector caps
- **Tax information**: Holding periods, unrealized gains/losses by lot, wash-sale exposure windows, client tax bracket [VERIFY — jurisdiction-specific capital gains treatment]
- **Transaction cost data**: Commission schedules, bid-ask spreads, estimated market impact for position sizes
- **Cash flow schedule**: Pending contributions, withdrawals, income distributions, or capital calls
- **Account structure**: Taxable vs. tax-deferred vs. tax-exempt accounts; sleeve or sub-advisor mandates

## Workflow

1. **Snapshot current allocation**
   - Pull current market values for all holdings and compute actual weights
   - Map holdings to the target allocation taxonomy (asset class, geography, sector)
   - Flag any unmapped or illiquid positions that cannot participate in rebalancing

2. **Calculate drift**
   - Compute absolute drift (actual weight − target weight) for each asset class
   - Compute relative drift (absolute drift ÷ target weight) where target weight > 0
   - Identify which positions breach policy tolerance bands
   - Rank breaches by severity to prioritize trading

3. **Generate rebalancing trades**
   - Determine net buy/sell amounts needed to return each asset class to target
   - Net cash flows against required trades to reduce unnecessary round-trip transactions
   - Apply minimum trade size filters — suppress trades below materiality thresholds
   - For multi-account households, identify optimal account placement (asset location)

4. **Apply tax-aware overlay**
   - Identify lots with short-term vs. long-term holding periods; prefer selling long-term lots when gains are unavoidable
   - Screen for tax-loss harvesting candidates — replace with correlated but non-substantially-identical substitutes [VERIFY — IRS wash-sale rule 30-day window and "substantially identical" definition]
   - Estimate net realized gain/loss impact of proposed trades
   - Compare pre-tax and after-tax rebalancing paths; defer high-cost trades when drift is within outer tolerance band
   - Check for wash-sale conflicts across related accounts

5. **Optimize transaction costs**
   - Estimate total trading cost (commissions + spread + market impact) for the proposed trade list
   - Consolidate or batch trades where crossing opportunities exist internally
   - Consider limit orders for positions with wide bid-ask spreads
   - Evaluate partial rebalancing if full rebalancing cost exceeds expected tracking-error reduction benefit

6. **Execute and document**
   - Generate a rebalancing trade blotter with security, direction, quantity, estimated cost, and tax impact
   - Record pre-trade and post-trade allocations side by side
   - Note any positions intentionally left out of tolerance (with rationale)
   - Log compliance pre-trade checks: restricted list, concentration limits, IPS constraints [VERIFY — firm-specific compliance rule sets]

7. **Post-trade monitoring**
   - Confirm settlement and reconcile executed fills against intended trades
   - Recalculate portfolio weights post-execution to verify drift is resolved
   - Update cost basis records and wash-sale tracking ledgers
   - Set next rebalancing review date or re-arm drift-monitoring alerts

## Output

- **Drift analysis report**: Table showing each asset class with target weight, actual weight, absolute drift, relative drift, and breach status
- **Proposed trade list**: Security-level detail with direction, shares/units, estimated proceeds or cost, commission, spread cost, and tax impact per lot
- **Tax impact summary**: Projected short-term and long-term realized gains/losses, wash-sale exposure, and net tax cost estimate
- **Transaction cost estimate**: Aggregate commission, spread cost, and market impact projection
- **Pre/post allocation comparison**: Side-by-side weights before and after proposed rebalancing
- **Exception log**: Positions excluded from rebalancing with documented rationale

## Quality Checks

- Verify that post-rebalancing weights fall within all policy tolerance bands
- Confirm no wash-sale violations are created across taxable accounts in the household
- Validate that total transaction cost does not exceed the expected benefit of reduced tracking error
- Ensure all trades comply with restricted security lists and concentration limits
- Check that cash reserves remain above minimum requirements after all proposed trades settle
- Confirm lot-level cost basis data matches custodian records before calculating tax impact [VERIFY — custodian cost basis reporting standards may vary]
- Review that any substitute securities used for tax-loss harvesting maintain comparable risk/return characteristics
