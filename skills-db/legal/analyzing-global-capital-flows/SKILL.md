# Analyzing Global Capital Flows

## When To Use

- Interpreting Balance of Payments (BOP) data to assess a country's external position
- Tracking hot money flows and short-term speculative capital movements
- Analyzing FDI trends, portfolio investment shifts, or reserve accumulation patterns
- Evaluating capital flight risk during macroeconomic stress or political instability
- Assessing the impact of capital controls, sanctions, or monetary policy divergence on cross-border flows
- Preparing macro research notes for sovereign credit, EM allocation, or policy advisory

## Inputs To Gather

- **BOP data**: Current account, financial account, and capital account breakdowns (IMF BOP statistics, central bank releases) — specify country and time range
- **Flow type focus**: FDI, portfolio equity, portfolio debt, bank lending, official reserve transactions, or remittances
- **Frequency and horizon**: Monthly, quarterly, or annual; trailing period vs. point-in-time snapshot
- **Currency and FX context**: Exchange rate regime (float, peg, managed), recent FX intervention data, swap line usage
- **Policy environment**: Interest rate differentials, capital control regime, sanctions status, tax treaty network [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific capital control rules]
- **Supplementary indicators**: EPFR fund flow data, SWIFT messaging volumes, TIC data (for US), BIS locational banking statistics, COFER reserve composition

## Workflow

1. **Define scope and decompose the BOP**
   - Identify target country or corridor (e.g., China-to-US, EM aggregate)
   - Break the BOP into standard components: current account (trade, income, transfers), financial account (FDI, portfolio, other investment, reserves), and net errors & omissions
   - Flag any large "errors and omissions" balance — this often signals unrecorded capital flight or measurement gaps

2. **Classify flow types and directionality**
   - Distinguish between FDI (greenfield vs. M&A), portfolio flows (equity vs. fixed income), banking flows (cross-border lending), and official flows (reserve accumulation/drawdown)
   - Separate gross inflows from gross outflows — net figures mask volatility and compositional shifts
   - Identify "sticky" flows (FDI, long-term debt) vs. "hot money" (short-term portfolio, carry-trade positions)

3. **Assess drivers and macro context**
   - Map flows against interest rate differentials, growth differentials, and risk appetite proxies (VIX, EM spread indices)
   - Evaluate policy drivers: QE/QT spillovers, capital control changes, tax incentive shifts, sanctions implementation timelines [VERIFY current sanctions regimes and effective dates]
   - Check for structural drivers: commodity price cycles (for resource exporters), demographic savings patterns, reserve diversification trends

4. **Identify hot money dynamics and reversal risk**
   - Calculate short-term external debt relative to FX reserves (Guidotti-Greenspan ratio)
   - Assess non-resident holdings of local currency bonds — high foreign ownership increases reversal sensitivity
   - Track fund flow data (EPFR, IIF) for momentum signals in portfolio allocation
   - Flag carry-trade vulnerability: high domestic rates + stable/appreciating currency + open capital account

5. **Evaluate sustainability and stress scenarios**
   - Apply basic external sustainability metrics: current account deficit / GDP, reserve import cover, short-term debt / reserves
   - Model a sudden-stop scenario: what happens if portfolio inflows reverse by 1-2 standard deviations?
   - Assess policy buffers: FX reserve adequacy (IMF ARA metric), swap line access, fiscal space for counter-cyclical response
   - Note any IMF program conditionality or multilateral financing arrangements in effect [VERIFY active IMF programs and conditionality terms]

6. **Synthesize findings and document**
   - Summarize the flow composition, dominant drivers, and directional trend
   - Highlight key vulnerabilities (concentration in hot money, reserve adequacy gaps, policy constraints)
   - Provide forward-looking assessment with scenario branching (base case, risk case)
   - Flag data lags and reporting gaps — BOP data typically arrives with 1-3 month delay

## Output

Produce an **Analysis Report** structured as:

- **Executive summary**: One-paragraph overview of flow dynamics, dominant trend, and key risk
- **BOP decomposition table**: Current account, financial account sub-components, reserves, errors & omissions — with period-over-period change
- **Flow classification matrix**: Sticky vs. hot, gross vs. net, by instrument type
- **Driver assessment**: Ranked list of macro drivers with directional impact on flows
- **Vulnerability dashboard**: Guidotti-Greenspan ratio, reserve import cover, non-resident bond holdings share, current account balance trend
- **Scenario analysis**: Base case and stress case with quantified flow reversal estimates
- **Data limitations**: Reporting lags, coverage gaps, proxy reliability notes

## Quality Checks

- Verify BOP components sum correctly (current account + financial account + capital account + errors & omissions = 0 in theory; flag material discrepancies)
- Confirm gross flow data is used where composition matters — do not rely solely on net figures
- Ensure interest rate and FX data are time-aligned with flow data periods
- Cross-check flow data across sources (IMF vs. central bank vs. BIS) for consistency; note discrepancies
- Validate that hot money classification criteria are applied consistently across all periods analyzed
- Mark all jurisdiction-dependent regulatory assumptions (capital controls, tax treaties, sanctions) with [VERIFY]
- Confirm reserve adequacy metrics use current standard benchmarks (IMF ARA or Guidotti-Greenspan) rather than outdated thresholds
