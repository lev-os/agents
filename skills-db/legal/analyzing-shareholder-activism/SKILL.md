# Analyzing Shareholder Activism

## When To Use

- An activist investor (hedge fund, individual, or group) has filed a 13D or 13D/A disclosing a position ≥5% in a public company
- A proxy fight, consent solicitation, or board nomination contest is underway or anticipated
- Evaluating whether to support management or the activist slate ahead of a shareholder vote
- Assessing the investment merit of entering or exiting a position in a company targeted by activists
- Reviewing historical activist campaigns at a company or by a specific activist fund for pattern analysis

## Inputs To Gather

- **Activist identity and track record**: Fund name, key principals, AUM, historical campaign win rate, typical holding period, and preferred sectors
- **13D/13D-A filings**: Ownership stake percentage, acquisition timeline, stated intentions, and any group formations
- **Activist thesis materials**: Public letters to the board, white papers, investor presentations, proposed slate bios
- **Company fundamentals**: Revenue, EBITDA, margins, capital allocation history, peer multiples, sum-of-parts valuation
- **Board and governance profile**: Board composition, tenure, independence ratio, share ownership by directors, classified board status, poison pill provisions, bylaw amendment thresholds [VERIFY against latest proxy statement]
- **Proxy advisory firm recommendations**: ISS and Glass Lewis reports if available
- **Prior activist history at the target**: Previous campaigns, settlements, board seats gained, operational or strategic changes implemented

## Workflow

1. **Map the activist's position and timeline**
   - Extract ownership percentage, cost basis (if disclosed), and accumulation pattern from 13D filing history
   - Identify whether the activist is acting alone or as part of a group (Item 2 of Schedule 13D)
   - Note any derivative positions (swaps, options) that supplement economic exposure

2. **Deconstruct the activist thesis**
   - Categorize the campaign type: operational improvement, capital return, strategic alternatives (M&A/spin-off/divestiture), governance reform, or management change
   - Quantify the activist's value creation claims — compare proposed margin targets, capital allocation changes, or valuation re-rating to current baseline
   - Stress-test key assumptions: Are margin targets realistic vs. peers? Is the proposed buyback/dividend funded? Does a breakup valuation hold under standalone cost structures?

3. **Assess company defenses and response**
   - Review defensive provisions: staggered board, advance notice bylaws, supermajority requirements, rights plan (poison pill) status [VERIFY — these vary by state of incorporation]
   - Evaluate management's public response and any preemptive operational changes (e.g., new buyback, cost initiative, strategic review announcement)
   - Gauge board willingness to settle vs. fight based on prior behavior and director profiles

4. **Evaluate proxy fight mechanics (if applicable)**
   - Determine the vote standard: majority vs. plurality, broker non-vote implications [VERIFY against company bylaws and exchange rules]
   - Analyze the shareholder base: institutional vs. retail mix, index fund holdings (which tend to follow ISS/Glass Lewis), known activist-friendly holders
   - Estimate vote outcome probability based on proxy advisory recommendations and shareholder composition

5. **Score the campaign and investment implications**
   - Assign a probability-weighted outcome assessment: full activist victory, partial settlement (board seats, operational concessions), or management prevails
   - Model upside/downside scenarios tied to each outcome — include timeline to value realization
   - Identify catalysts and signposts: proxy filing deadlines, annual meeting date, settlement negotiation windows, 13D amendment signals

## Output

Produce a structured **Activist Campaign Analysis Report** containing:

- **Campaign summary**: One-paragraph overview of activist, target, stake, thesis, and current status
- **Thesis breakdown table**: Activist's proposed actions, quantified impact claims, and analyst assessment of feasibility (High / Medium / Low)
- **Defense posture assessment**: Governance provisions, management response quality, and settlement likelihood
- **Vote probability matrix** (if proxy fight is live): Estimated vote by shareholder category with sensitivity to ISS/Glass Lewis recommendations
- **Investment conclusion**: Probability-weighted price target range, recommended position sizing or action (enter, hold, exit, hedge), and key risk factors
- **Timeline of key dates**: 13D filing date, nomination deadline, annual meeting date, settlement windows

## Quality Checks

- Confirm all ownership percentages and filing dates against SEC EDGAR source documents
- Verify governance provisions (board classification, poison pill, bylaw thresholds) against the most recent proxy statement and charter — these change frequently [VERIFY]
- Cross-check activist track record claims against actual outcomes from prior campaigns
- Ensure valuation assumptions (multiples, margins, cost of capital) are sourced and defensible against peer data
- Flag any material non-public information concerns — analysis must rely exclusively on public filings and disclosures
- Confirm that vote standard and shareholder base composition reflect the specific company's bylaws and most recent institutional ownership filings (13F data)
