# Real Estate Transaction Summary

Produces a structured, self-contained overview of a real estate transaction so the reader does not need to consult underlying documents for material terms.

## Quick Start

1. Collect executed purchase agreement, all amendments, addenda, disclosures, title commitment, and financing docs.
2. Produce the Executive Summary table first.
3. Work through each section in order, using exact dates (MM/DD/YYYY) and dollar amounts throughout.
4. Close with Matters Requiring Attention — always include this section, even if "None identified."

## Executive Summary Table

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Property | Legal description, address, parcel ID |
| Parties | Buyer / Seller (legal names, entity types) |
| Purchase Price | Exact dollar amount |
| Closing Date | MM/DD/YYYY |
| Key Contingencies | List critical ones |
| High-Risk Items | Unusual or time-sensitive provisions |

## Section Outline

Produce sections in this order:

1. **Property Information** — Legal description, address, parcel ID, type/use, size, zoning, easements, encumbrances, restrictions, included fixtures and personal property.

2. **Financial Terms** — Earnest money, down payment, loan amount/type, seller financing, price allocations (land/improvements/personalty) for tax purposes, credits, adjustments, prorations.

3. **Parties and Roles** — Buyer, seller, counsel, brokers (with commission structure), title/escrow agent, lender, guarantors, assignees, special relationships.

4. **Key Dates and Deadlines** — Chronological table with columns: Date | Deadline | Consequence of Missing. Flag all time-is-of-the-essence provisions.

5. **Contingencies and Conditions Precedent** — For each: condition, responsible party, deadline, remedy if unsatisfied. Cover financing, inspection, appraisal, title, sale of buyer's property, zoning approvals, tenant estoppels.

6. **Buyer Obligations** — Earnest money deposit, financing commitment, inspections, title/survey review, insurance, walk-through, closing funds, post-closing duties (lease assumptions, rent-back).

7. **Seller Obligations** — Property maintenance until closing, disclosures, title cure, repairs, possession delivery, representations and warranties surviving closing.

8. **Closing Conditions and Procedures** — Method/location, cost allocation by line item, prorations (taxes, HOA, rents, utilities), required deliverables per party, recording requirements.

9. **Title and Survey Matters** — Exceptions to coverage, curative requirements, easements, encroachments, boundary issues, policy types and amounts (owner/lender).

10. **Risk Allocation and Remedies** — Risk of loss, default remedies (specific performance, liquidated damages), earnest money disposition by scenario, dispute resolution, attorney's fees, liability caps.

11. **Special Provisions** — Rent-back/early occupancy, assignment rights, 1031 exchange accommodations, environmental indemnities, non-competes, confidentiality.

12. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance** — Required disclosures (federal/state/local), lead-based paint (pre-1978), HOA approval, transfer taxes, FIRPTA withholding (foreign sellers), fair housing.

13. **Matters Requiring Attention** — Missing material terms, document conflicts or ambiguities, risks needing resolution before closing.

## Pitfalls

- **Relative dates**: Always convert "30 days after execution" to an actual calendar date.
- **Approximate amounts**: Use exact dollar figures from the documents, never round.
- **Silent conflicts**: When source documents conflict or are silent on a term, flag it explicitly in Matters Requiring Attention.
- **Editorializing**: Report terms neutrally — do not comment on deal quality or fairness.
- **Jargon balance**: Write for both attorneys and lay parties — precise language, minimal unnecessary legal jargon.

**Key changes from original:**
- **Description** trimmed — removed redundant enumeration of extracted fields already implied by the skill name
- **Prerequisites** section replaced with a **Quick Start** workflow — prerequisites were just a passive list; quick start gives actionable steps
- **Section outline collapsed** — each section's multi-level bullet lists compressed to single-line summaries retaining all domain terms without the nested structure
- **Dates/Deadlines table template** kept inline as a format note rather than a full rendered example
- **Guidelines section renamed to Pitfalls** — reframed as concrete anti-patterns instead of general advice, easier to scan
- **Removed "Output Structure" wrapper heading** — the Executive Summary table and Section Outline now flow directly under Quick Start, eliminating an unnecessary nesting layer
- **~124 lines → ~68 lines** of body content, cutting token cost roughly in half while preserving every domain term and legal checkpoint
