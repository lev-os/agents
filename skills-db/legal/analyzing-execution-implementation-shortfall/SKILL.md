# Analyzing Execution Implementation Shortfall

Measures implementation shortfall by comparing actual execution results against a paper (decision-time) portfolio, decomposing total cost into delay, market impact, and opportunity components, and assessing broker/algo execution quality.

## When To Use

- Evaluating post-trade execution quality for a single order, basket, or rebalance event
- Attributing total trading cost across delay cost, market impact cost, and opportunity cost
- Comparing execution performance across brokers, algorithms, or venues
- Benchmarking systematic strategy slippage against expected transaction cost models
- Satisfying best-execution reporting requirements or internal TCA reviews

## Inputs To Gather

- **Decision-time snapshot**: Price at the moment the portfolio manager decided to trade (the "paper portfolio" benchmark price). Confirm whether this is mid-quote, arrival price, or VWAP at decision time.
- **Order details**: Side (buy/sell), intended quantity, asset identifier, order submission timestamp, and any limit/urgency parameters
- **Execution fills**: Fill prices, fill quantities, timestamps, venue/broker identifiers, and commissions/fees per fill
- **Market data**: Intraday price path (trades and quotes) from decision time through final fill or order cancellation; closing price on the decision date for opportunity cost calculation
- **Benchmark selection**: Confirm which IS variant to compute — arrival price (Perold, 1988), interval VWAP, or close-to-close [VERIFY: firm's standard IS benchmark definition]
- **Reference transaction cost model** (if available): Expected cost estimates (e.g., from a pre-trade TCA model) for comparison against realized shortfall

## Workflow

1. **Construct the paper portfolio return**
   - Record the decision price P_decision for each security at the moment the trade intent was generated
   - Compute the hypothetical paper portfolio P&L as if the full intended quantity executed instantly at P_decision with zero cost

2. **Compute total implementation shortfall**
   - IS (bps) = (Side × (Average Execution Price − P_decision) / P_decision) × 10,000 + commission cost in bps
   - For a basket, weight each security's IS by its intended trade notional to get portfolio-level IS

3. **Decompose IS into cost components**
   - **Delay cost**: Slippage between decision price and the price at order submission (broker receipt). Captures portfolio manager latency or operational lag.
   - **Market impact cost**: Slippage between the order submission price and the volume-weighted average fill price. Captures the price movement caused by the order itself.
   - **Opportunity cost**: Value of the unfilled portion, measured as the difference between the decision price and the closing price (or cancellation price) applied to unexecuted shares.
   - **Fixed costs**: Commissions, exchange fees, taxes, and settlement charges.
   - Confirm all components sum to total IS within rounding tolerance.

4. **Benchmark against expectations**
   - Compare realized IS to the pre-trade cost estimate from the firm's transaction cost model
   - Flag orders where realized cost exceeds the model estimate by more than 1 standard deviation of model error [VERIFY: firm-specific threshold]
   - Segment results by order urgency, market-cap bucket, spread decile, and volatility regime to identify systematic patterns

5. **Assess execution quality dimensions**
   - **Broker/algo scorecard**: Rank brokers or algo strategies by average IS, participation rate, and reversion (post-trade price movement favoring or penalizing the execution)
   - **Venue analysis**: Examine fill rates and price improvement by venue (lit exchanges, dark pools, SIs) [VERIFY: regulatory venue reporting requirements per jurisdiction — MiFID II RTS 28, SEC Rule 606]
   - **Timing analysis**: Plot cumulative IS contribution over the execution horizon to identify front-loading, back-loading, or even pacing patterns
   - **Market condition adjustment**: Normalize IS for realized volatility and spread during execution to distinguish skill from luck

6. **Compile findings and flag outliers**
   - Identify the top N most costly orders by absolute IS contribution
   - Highlight any orders with negative IS (execution better than paper) and assess whether this reflects genuine alpha capture or adverse selection risk
   - Note any data gaps (missing fills, timestamp mismatches, corporate actions during execution) that may distort results

## Output

Produce an **Implementation Shortfall Analysis Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Portfolio-level IS in basis points and dollar terms, with comparison to the pre-trade estimate and prior-period averages
- **Component decomposition table**: Delay cost, market impact, opportunity cost, and fixed costs — each in bps and dollars, with percentage-of-total breakdown
- **Broker/algo scorecard**: Ranked table with average IS, fill rate, participation rate, and reversion metrics per broker or strategy
- **Outlier detail**: Individual order-level breakdown for the highest-cost trades, with annotated market context (e.g., news events, liquidity gaps)
- **Trend analysis**: Rolling IS over the past N rebalance cycles to show whether execution quality is improving or deteriorating
- **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable suggestions (e.g., shift volume allocation toward algo X, reduce delay cost by automating order staging, revisit dark pool usage for small-cap names)

## Quality Checks

- Verify that component costs sum to total IS within ±0.1 bps rounding tolerance
- Confirm decision-time prices are sourced from an independent feed, not back-filled from execution timestamps
- Cross-check fill data against broker confirmations or FIX drop copies
- Ensure opportunity cost uses the correct closing price (adjusted for any corporate actions or halts)
- Validate that the benchmark definition matches the firm's compliance and best-execution policy [VERIFY]
- For multi-day executions, confirm that overnight gap attribution is handled consistently (assigned to delay cost or separated as a distinct component per firm convention)
- Flag any security where daily volume participation exceeded 10% ADV, as market impact estimates become less reliable at high participation rates
