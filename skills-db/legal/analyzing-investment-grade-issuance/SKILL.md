# Analyzing Investment Grade Issuance

## When To Use

- Advising a corporate issuer on timing, structure, or pricing of an investment-grade bond offering
- Benchmarking credit spreads for a specific issuer against sector comps and index levels
- Evaluating maturity curve positioning (e.g., 5Y vs. 10Y vs. 30Y) for optimal cost of capital
- Assessing primary market demand signals ahead of a potential new issue
- Preparing market-conditions sections for internal credit committee or board presentations
- Comparing fixed-rate vs. floating-rate IG tranches or USD vs. EUR issuance economics

## Inputs To Gather

- **Issuer profile**: Credit ratings (Moody's/S&P/Fitch), sector, outstanding debt stack, recent earnings or leverage metrics
- **Target parameters**: Approximate deal size, desired tenor(s), currency, fixed vs. floating preference, use of proceeds
- **Market data**: Current benchmark Treasury/swap rates, IG index spreads (CDX.IG, iBoxx), sector spread curves
- **Comparable transactions**: Recent IG new issues in the same sector and rating bucket (pricing date, coupon, spread, book size, NIC)
- **Investor context**: Recent demand trends from order books, geographic allocation patterns, real-money vs. bank demand mix
- **Macro backdrop**: Fed/ECB policy outlook, upcoming economic data releases, supply calendar for competing issuance [VERIFY current rate environment and central bank guidance]

## Workflow

1. **Establish baseline spreads**
   - Pull current spread levels for the issuer's rating category across the maturity curve (2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, 30Y)
   - Compare issuer-specific secondary spreads (if bonds outstanding) to sector and rating-bucket medians
   - Note any basis between CDS and cash spreads that may indicate technical supply/demand imbalances

2. **Analyze comparable new issues**
   - Identify 5–10 recent primary deals in the same sector and rating range (ideally within the last 60 days)
   - For each comp, record: tenor, coupon, reoffer spread, new-issue concession (NIC), book coverage ratio, and secondary trading performance (Day 1 and Day 7 tightening)
   - Calculate median NIC and book-cover by tenor bucket to establish pricing expectations

3. **Evaluate maturity curve economics**
   - Build an all-in cost comparison across tenors: reoffer yield = benchmark rate + estimated spread + estimated NIC
   - Identify the "cheapest" point on the curve relative to the issuer's existing debt maturity profile and refinancing needs
   - Flag any maturity wall concentrations that argue for or against specific tenors

4. **Assess investor demand conditions**
   - Review recent primary order-book statistics: oversubscription levels, pricing revisions (tightening from IPTs to final), allocation skew
   - Identify demand pockets by investor type (insurance/pension favoring long end, asset managers mid-curve, banks short end)
   - Note any seasonal or event-driven factors affecting demand (quarter-end, index rebalancing, blackout periods) [VERIFY index rebalancing dates]

5. **Determine issuance window and risk factors**
   - Map the forward calendar for competing IG supply in the target week
   - Identify macro risk events (FOMC, payrolls, CPI) that could move benchmark rates or spreads during the execution window
   - Recommend optimal launch day/time and whether to run a single-day or multi-day execution

6. **Synthesize recommendation**
   - Recommend target tenor(s) and tranche structure (single vs. multi-tranche)
   - Provide spread guidance range: initial price thoughts (IPTs) and expected final pricing
   - Estimate total all-in coupon cost and compare to issuer's existing weighted-average cost of debt
   - Highlight key risks and contingency triggers (e.g., "delay if CDX.IG widens >10bp from current levels")

## Output

Deliver a structured analysis report containing:

- **Market Overview**: 2–3 paragraph summary of current IG market conditions, recent spread trends, and macro backdrop
- **Comparable Transactions Table**: Tabular display of recent comps with spread, NIC, book cover, and secondary performance
- **Maturity Curve Analysis**: Chart-ready data showing all-in cost by tenor with recommendation highlighted
- **Demand Assessment**: Summary of investor appetite indicators with qualitative rating (Strong / Favorable / Neutral / Weak)
- **Issuance Recommendation**: Recommended structure, pricing range, execution timing, and key risk factors
- **Sensitivity Scenarios**: How estimated pricing changes under ±25bp and ±50bp benchmark rate moves

## Quality Checks

- Confirm all spread data references a consistent date; flag any stale quotes older than 2 business days
- Verify that comparable transactions are genuinely comparable (same broad rating category, similar sector, within 90 days)
- Ensure NIC calculations use the correct benchmark interpolation (on-the-run Treasury vs. swap curve) [VERIFY issuer's preferred benchmark convention]
- Cross-check that recommended tenor aligns with the issuer's stated maturity profile objectives and any covenant constraints
- Validate that macro event calendar is current and complete for the proposed execution window
- Confirm all ratings referenced are current; flag any issuer on CreditWatch or outlook change within last 90 days [VERIFY rating agency actions]
