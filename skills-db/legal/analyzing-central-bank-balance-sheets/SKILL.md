# Analyzing Central Bank Balance Sheets

## When To Use

- Evaluating the impact of quantitative easing (QE) or quantitative tightening (QT) on asset composition and reserve levels
- Analyzing shifts in a central bank's holdings (treasuries, MBS, corporate bonds, FX reserves) over time
- Assessing transmission mechanisms from balance sheet operations to money markets, yield curves, and bank reserves
- Comparing balance sheet strategies across central banks (Fed, ECB, BOJ, BOE, PBOC)
- Tracking reserve management during crisis interventions, lending facility usage, or currency defense operations

## Inputs To Gather

- **Balance sheet data**: Most recent H.4.1 (Fed), Weekly Financial Statement (ECB), or equivalent release; at minimum two comparison dates for trend analysis
- **Target central bank**: Identify which institution(s) — policies, mandates, and accounting conventions differ materially [VERIFY jurisdiction-specific reporting format]
- **Time horizon**: Specify whether analysis covers a single policy cycle, crisis window, or multi-year structural trend
- **Policy context**: Current rate stance, forward guidance language, announced QE/QT pace or caps
- **Market data** (if assessing transmission): Overnight rates, term repo rates, yield curve snapshots, bank reserve balances, money market fund flows

## Workflow

1. **Map the balance sheet structure**
   - Decompose assets: government securities (by maturity bucket), MBS/agency debt, lending facilities (discount window, BTFP, TLTROs), FX reserves, gold, other assets
   - Decompose liabilities: currency in circulation, bank reserves (required vs. excess), reverse repo / standing deposit facility, Treasury General Account (or government deposits), foreign official deposits, capital and surplus
   - Note any off-balance-sheet commitments (swap lines, forward commitments)

2. **Quantify QE/QT impact**
   - Calculate net asset purchases or runoff over the analysis period
   - Break down by instrument type — distinguish between active purchases/sales and passive maturity runoff
   - Compute pace: monthly/weekly run-rate vs. announced caps (e.g., Fed's $60B Treasury / $35B MBS monthly cap)
   - Identify reinvestment policy: full reinvestment, partial, or none; any maturity composition shifts

3. **Analyze reserve dynamics**
   - Track total reserve balances and their distribution (large vs. small banks where data permits)
   - Identify reserve-draining factors: TGA rebuilds, RRP uptake, currency growth, increased required reserves
   - Identify reserve-adding factors: QE purchases, lending facility draws, FX intervention
   - Assess proximity to "lowest comfortable level of reserves" (LCLoR) or equivalent scarcity threshold [VERIFY — the specific framework varies by central bank]

4. **Assess market transmission**
   - Overnight rate vs. target range: is the effective rate drifting toward the floor or ceiling?
   - Yield curve impact: term premium estimates, duration extraction effect
   - Credit spread compression/widening tied to balance sheet operations
   - Funding market stress indicators: FRA-OIS spread, cross-currency basis, T-bill / RRP rate dynamics

5. **Evaluate risks and forward path**
   - Identify potential inflection points: reserve scarcity, RRP facility drawdown exhaustion, TGA refill pressure
   - Assess unrealized losses on the portfolio (mark-to-market vs. amortized cost) and remittance implications [VERIFY accounting treatment — Fed uses deferred asset; ECB distributes differently]
   - Flag political or institutional risks: fiscal dominance concerns, central bank independence pressures
   - Project balance sheet trajectory under announced policy vs. stress scenarios

## Output

Structure the analysis report with:

- **Executive summary**: One paragraph stating the central bank, analysis period, key balance sheet change, and primary finding
- **Balance sheet snapshot table**: Side-by-side comparison (start date vs. end date) of major asset and liability line items with absolute and percentage changes
- **QE/QT tracker**: Cumulative and monthly pace of net asset changes by instrument
- **Reserve analysis**: Current level, trend, and distance from estimated scarcity threshold
- **Transmission assessment**: Summary of observed market impacts with supporting rate/spread data
- **Forward outlook**: Projected balance sheet path, key risks, and scenario-dependent inflection points
- **Data sources and limitations**: Cite specific releases, dates, and any interpolation or estimation used

## Quality Checks

- Confirm assets = liabilities + capital; if the balance sheet does not foot, investigate before proceeding
- Verify that reported QE/QT pace aligns with official announcements — flag any discrepancy
- Cross-check reserve data against money market rate behavior (reserves declining while overnight rate is stable may indicate adequate buffers; reserves declining while rate spikes suggest scarcity)
- Ensure maturity composition analysis uses consistent bucket definitions across comparison dates
- Mark all jurisdiction-dependent thresholds, accounting conventions, and regulatory frameworks with [VERIFY]
- Do not extrapolate one central bank's framework to another without explicit justification — mandate structures, collateral policies, and counterparty access differ materially
