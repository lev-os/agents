# Managing Risk Transfer Analysis

## When To Use

- Evaluating whether current risk retention levels are economically efficient versus transferring risk to insurers or reinsurers
- Assessing captive insurance feasibility or optimizing an existing captive program
- Analyzing alternative risk transfer (ART) structures such as risk retention groups, parametric covers, cat bonds, or industry loss warranties
- Reviewing reinsurance program structure (quota share, excess of loss, aggregate stop-loss) for capacity and cost optimization
- Preparing management recommendations on risk financing strategy for board or C-suite review

## Inputs To Gather

- **Loss history**: Minimum 5–10 years of incurred and paid loss data by line of business, including large-loss detail and development triangles
- **Current program structure**: Policy declarations, reinsurance contracts, retention levels, attachment points, and limits
- **Premium and cost data**: Gross and net premiums, ceding commissions, captive operating expenses, collateral/LOC costs
- **Exposure profile**: Total insured values, revenue/payroll bases, unit counts, geographic and hazard concentration data
- **Risk appetite statement**: Board-approved retention tolerances, maximum probable loss thresholds, and capital-at-risk limits
- **Market intelligence**: Current reinsurance pricing indications, capacity availability, and carrier credit ratings
- **Tax and regulatory context**: Domicile-specific captive regulations, risk distribution requirements, fronting arrangements [VERIFY]

## Workflow

1. **Map the current risk financing structure**
   - Diagram retention layers, insured layers, and reinsured layers by line of business
   - Identify all funding mechanisms: retention, deductibles, self-insured retentions (SIRs), captive, commercial insurance, reinsurance, ART
   - Calculate total cost of risk (TCOR) including premiums, retained losses, admin costs, and cost of capital on reserves

2. **Perform retention analysis**
   - Run actuarial loss projections at multiple retention levels (e.g., $100K, $250K, $500K, $1M SIR)
   - Compare expected retained losses + risk margin against premium savings at each retention level
   - Model tail-risk exposure using loss distribution fitting (lognormal, Pareto) and simulation
   - Calculate optimal retention point where marginal premium savings equal marginal expected loss plus risk charge

3. **Evaluate transfer mechanisms**
   - **Traditional insurance/reinsurance**: Assess quota share vs. excess of loss vs. aggregate stop-loss efficiency; compare cedant retention, rate-on-line, and recovery patterns
   - **Captive structures**: Model captive feasibility including minimum premium volume, expected underwriting result, investment income, and risk distribution requirements [VERIFY domicile-specific rules: Vermont, Bermuda, Cayman, etc.]
   - **ART instruments**: Evaluate parametric triggers (basis risk vs. indemnity), cat bond pricing vs. traditional retro, and ILW correlation to portfolio losses
   - Score each mechanism on: cost efficiency, capacity provided, counterparty credit risk, operational complexity, and regulatory/tax treatment

4. **Optimize the program structure**
   - Build a blended program model combining mechanisms across layers to minimize TCOR at the target confidence level (e.g., 95th or 99th percentile)
   - Stress-test under adverse scenarios: 1-in-100 loss events, simultaneous multi-line losses, reinsurer default, and market hardening (+25% rate)
   - Quantify capital efficiency gains (e.g., freed economic capital, improved risk-adjusted return on capital)

5. **Prepare management recommendation**
   - Present current vs. proposed program side-by-side with TCOR comparison
   - Highlight key trade-offs: cost savings vs. tail exposure, operational complexity vs. flexibility, tax benefits vs. regulatory burden
   - Provide implementation roadmap with timeline, broker/reinsurer negotiation steps, and board approval requirements

## Output

The deliverable is a **Risk Transfer Analysis Report** containing:

- **Executive summary**: Key findings, recommended program changes, and projected TCOR impact
- **Current program overview**: Visual layer diagram with retentions, limits, and costs by line
- **Retention analysis**: Table of retention options with expected loss, premium savings, and risk-adjusted cost at each level
- **Transfer mechanism evaluation**: Comparative scoring matrix across traditional, captive, and ART options
- **Recommended program structure**: Proposed layer diagram with cost projections and stress-test results
- **Implementation plan**: Sequenced action items, responsible parties, and target dates
- **Appendices**: Loss development triangles, actuarial assumptions, market pricing benchmarks

## Quality Checks

- Verify loss data is developed to ultimate and adjusted for trend/inflation before modeling
- Confirm retention analysis includes both expected value and volatility measures (standard deviation, VaR, TVaR)
- Ensure captive feasibility analysis addresses risk distribution and economic substance requirements [VERIFY by domicile]
- Validate that TCOR calculations include all cost components — do not omit cost of capital, collateral costs, or administrative overhead
- Check that counterparty credit risk is assessed for all transfer partners (use AM Best, S&P ratings at minimum)
- Confirm stress scenarios are calibrated to the organization's actual exposure profile, not generic industry benchmarks
- Flag any lines of business where data is insufficient for credible actuarial analysis — recommend using industry loss benchmarks with explicit credibility weighting
