# Building Driver Based Models

## When To Use

- Building a forecast model that ties operational metrics (headcount, units sold, utilization rates) to financial outcomes (revenue, COGS, operating expenses)
- Replacing static spreadsheet budgets with dynamic models where changing one driver cascades through the P&L, balance sheet, or cash flow
- Preparing scenario analyses for board presentations, fundraising narratives, or strategic planning cycles
- Linking departmental KPIs to consolidated financial statements for management reporting

## Inputs To Gather

- **Business context**: industry, business model (SaaS, manufacturing, services, retail), revenue streams, and cost structure
- **Historical data**: 12-36 months of actuals for revenue, expenses, headcount, and unit economics; identify which periods are representative vs. anomalous
- **Operational drivers to model**: e.g., leads → conversion rate → customers → ARPU → revenue; or units produced → materials cost per unit → direct labor hours → COGS
- **Assumptions and constraints**: growth targets, hiring plans, pricing changes, capacity limits, capital expenditure schedules
- **Granularity requirements**: monthly vs. quarterly cadence, department-level vs. consolidated, single entity vs. multi-entity
- **Sensitivity parameters**: which 2-5 drivers are most uncertain and should be toggled in scenario analysis

## Workflow

1. **Map the driver tree**
   - Identify 3-7 primary drivers per revenue stream and major cost category
   - Build a driver hierarchy: top-level financial line items → intermediate metrics → base operational inputs
   - Example revenue tree: website visits → lead conversion % → qualified leads → close rate → new customers → average contract value → new ARR
   - Example cost tree: headcount by department → fully loaded cost per head → total personnel expense; or units shipped → packaging cost/unit → freight cost/unit → total fulfillment cost

2. **Structure the model layout**
   - **Assumptions tab**: all tunable inputs in one place — growth rates, pricing, conversion rates, cost-per-unit figures, hiring timeline
   - **Driver calculations tab**: intermediate computations linking assumptions to financial outputs
   - **Output tabs**: P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet (or whichever statements are in scope)
   - **Scenarios tab**: base, upside, and downside cases toggled by changing assumption sets
   - Use named ranges or clear cell references; never hardcode numbers inside formulas

3. **Build driver-to-output linkages**
   - Wire each financial line item to its driver chain — no line item should be a flat manual entry unless truly fixed
   - For revenue: connect volume drivers × price drivers, accounting for churn/retention where applicable
   - For variable costs: tie to the volume driver they scale with (e.g., COGS scales with units sold, hosting costs scale with active users)
   - For semi-variable costs: model the fixed base plus the variable component (e.g., customer support = base team + 1 FTE per 500 incremental accounts)
   - For fixed costs: link to timing assumptions (lease start dates, SaaS contract renewals) rather than flat monthly amounts where possible
   - [VERIFY] Tax rate assumptions, depreciation methods, and capitalization thresholds against the entity's jurisdiction and accounting policy

4. **Run sensitivity and scenario analysis**
   - Select the 3-5 highest-impact, highest-uncertainty drivers
   - Build a data table or scenario toggle showing how changes in each driver affect EBITDA, cash runway, or the target metric
   - Construct at minimum: base case (management plan), downside (stress test on demand or pricing), upside (accelerated growth or margin expansion)
   - Document what "downside" and "upside" mean quantitatively (e.g., "downside = 20% lower conversion rate and 10% higher CAC")

5. **Validate and stress-test**
   - Check that the model balances: assets = liabilities + equity on every period; cash flow reconciles to balance sheet cash movement
   - Compare model outputs against historical actuals — if the model cannot replicate last year's results with last year's inputs, the driver structure is wrong
   - Test extreme inputs: what happens if a key driver goes to zero or doubles? The model should degrade gracefully, not produce errors or nonsensical outputs
   - Verify unit economics implied by the model (e.g., LTV:CAC ratio, gross margin %) are within plausible industry ranges [VERIFY]

## Output

- **Driver map diagram**: visual showing the hierarchy from operational inputs → intermediate metrics → financial line items
- **Assumptions summary**: table of all input assumptions with source/basis noted (historical average, management target, industry benchmark)
- **Linked financial model**: P&L (and optionally balance sheet/cash flow) with every line item traceable to its driver chain
- **Scenario comparison table**: base/upside/downside side-by-side with key metrics (revenue, EBITDA, cash balance, burn rate)
- **Sensitivity matrix**: tornado chart or data table showing which drivers move the target metric most

## Quality Checks

- Every financial line item traces back to at least one operational driver — no orphan rows with hardcoded values
- Changing any single assumption in the assumptions tab correctly cascades through all dependent calculations
- Model reproduces historical actuals within 5% tolerance when fed historical driver values
- Scenario outputs are internally consistent (e.g., headcount in downside case still supports the revenue volume assumed)
- All external benchmarks, tax rates, and regulatory thresholds are marked [VERIFY] with source noted
- Assumptions tab clearly distinguishes between data-backed inputs and management estimates
