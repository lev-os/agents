# Analyzing Credit Ratings

Interprets and anticipates credit rating actions with methodology analysis and surveillance monitoring.

## When To Use

- Evaluating an issuer's current credit rating relative to fundamental performance and peer positioning
- Predicting potential rating upgrades, downgrades, or outlook changes before official agency action
- Assessing the impact of a rating action on bond spreads, portfolio positioning, or trade execution
- Comparing rating methodologies across S&P, Moody's, and Fitch for the same issuer or sector
- Monitoring CreditWatch/Rating Watch placements and estimating resolution direction and timing

## Inputs To Gather

- **Issuer identity and sector**: Name, ticker, CUSIP/ISIN, GICS sector, and sub-industry classification
- **Current ratings**: Long-term and short-term ratings from each agency, including outlook (Stable/Positive/Negative) and any Watch status
- **Rating history**: Timeline of all rating actions over the prior 3-5 years with stated rationale for each move
- **Financial statements**: At minimum, last 4 quarters and 3 annual periods — income statement, balance sheet, cash flow
- **Agency methodology**: The applicable criteria document (e.g., S&P Corporate Ratings Methodology, Moody's sector-specific scorecard) [VERIFY: confirm current published version for the relevant sector]
- **Market data**: Current credit spreads (OAS), CDS levels, and recent price action on the issuer's bonds
- **Event catalysts**: Any pending M&A, debt issuance, restructuring, litigation, or regulatory action that could trigger a rating review

## Workflow

1. **Map the current rating position**
   - Record ratings from all three major agencies with outlooks and Watch status
   - Identify any split ratings (e.g., BBB- at S&P vs. Ba1 at Moody's) and note the divergence drivers
   - Determine where the issuer sits within the rating category (high/mid/low end) based on agency commentary

2. **Apply the relevant scorecard methodology**
   - Pull the applicable agency criteria document for the issuer's sector [VERIFY: sector-specific methodology version and effective date]
   - Score each key factor (leverage, coverage, liquidity, business risk, governance) using agency-defined thresholds
   - Compute the indicative scorecard outcome and compare to the assigned rating — flag any notching gaps

3. **Analyze financial trajectory and triggers**
   - Calculate key credit metrics: Debt/EBITDA, FFO/Debt, Interest Coverage (EBITDA/Interest), Free Cash Flow/Debt
   - Identify agency-stated upgrade and downgrade triggers from the most recent rating action report
   - Project metrics forward 1-2 years under base and stress scenarios to test trigger proximity
   - Flag any covenant or liquidity thresholds that could accelerate a negative trajectory

4. **Assess qualitative and structural factors**
   - Evaluate management's stated financial policy (leverage targets, shareholder return priorities, M&A appetite)
   - Review structural subordination, recovery analysis, and debt maturity profile
   - Consider sovereign ceiling constraints for non-US issuers [VERIFY: applicable country ceiling policy]
   - Weigh ESG factors where agencies have explicitly incorporated them into the methodology

5. **Benchmark against peer group**
   - Select 4-6 rated peers within the same sector and rating category
   - Compare key metrics on a relative basis — identify whether the issuer is an outlier in either direction
   - Note any recent peer rating actions that could signal sector-wide momentum

6. **Formulate the rating outlook assessment**
   - Synthesize scorecard output, financial trajectory, qualitative factors, and peer positioning
   - Assign a directional probability: Upgrade likely / Stable / Downgrade risk / Imminent Watch negative
   - Estimate the time horizon for potential action (near-term 0-6 months vs. medium-term 6-18 months)
   - Identify the single most important swing factor that would change the assessment

## Output

- **Rating Summary Table**: Current ratings (all agencies), outlooks, Watch status, and last action dates
- **Scorecard Analysis**: Factor-by-factor scoring with indicative vs. assigned rating comparison
- **Key Metrics Dashboard**: Historical and projected credit metrics with agency trigger thresholds highlighted
- **Peer Comparison Matrix**: Side-by-side metrics for the issuer and selected peers
- **Rating Direction Assessment**: Directional call with supporting rationale, confidence level, key swing factor, and estimated time horizon
- **Risk Flags**: Any items requiring immediate attention (trigger breach, Watch placement, event catalyst)

## Quality Checks

- Confirm that all three agency ratings are current and reflect the most recent action — cross-check against agency websites
- Verify that the scorecard methodology version used matches the agency's currently effective criteria [VERIFY]
- Ensure financial metrics are calculated using agency-specific adjustments (e.g., Moody's standard adjustments for leases, pensions, hybrid equity credit) rather than unadjusted GAAP/IFRS figures
- Check that upgrade/downgrade triggers cited are sourced directly from the agency's published rating action, not inferred
- Validate that peer comparisons use a consistent metric definition across all issuers
- Confirm that any forward projections clearly state assumptions and are labeled as estimates, not agency guidance
- Flag split ratings explicitly and explain the divergence rather than defaulting to the median
